# Data
Data is an incredibly broad topic but it can be broken down into many
subsections, including (in no particular order):

* data processing / wrangling
* machine learning
* data analysis
* visualization
* geospatial mapping
* persistence via [relational databases](/databases.html) and 
  [NoSQL data stores](/no-sql-datastore.html)
* [object-relational mappers](/object-relational-mappers-orms.html)
* natural language processing (NLP)
* indexing, search and retrieval

The Python community has built and continues to create open source libraries 
and tutorials for all of the above topics.


## Why is Python a great language choice for data tasks?
Python has a wide array of open source code libraries available and a
diverse community of people with different backgrounds who contribute to
make those libraries better each day.

In addition, Python data manipulation code can be combined with 
[web frameworks](/web-frameworks.html) and
[web APIs](/application-programming-interfaces.html) to build software
that would be difficult to create with a single other language. For example,
Ruby is a fantastic language for building web applications but its data
analysis and visualization libraries are very limited compared to what
is currently available in the Python ecosystem.


## How did Python become so widely used for working with data?
Python is a general purpose programming language and can be applied to
many problem areas. Over the past couple of decades, Python has become 
increasingly popular in the scientific and financial communities. Projects
such as [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) grew out of a hedge-fund while
[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) were
created in academic environments then improved by the broader open source
community.

The question is: why Python was used to created these projects? The answer
is a mix of luck, the growth of the open source community as Python was
maturing and wide adoption by people not formally trained as computer 
scientists. The pragmatic syntax and explicit style helped very intelligent
people without programming backgrounds to pick up the language and get their
work done with less fuss than other programming languages. Over time the
code used in the financial world and scientific community was shared at the
same time global open source communities were developing, further spreading
their usage among a broader base of software developers.

There's no doubt some of the momentum behind Python's wide adoption for all 
types of data manipulation was that it happened to be the right language in
the right place at the right time. Nevertheless, it was ultimately the hard 
work of a massive number of engineers and scientists around the world who
created the incredible mix of data code libraries available today.


### General Python data resources
* [PyData](http://pydata.org/) is a community for developer and users of 
  Python data tools. They put on fantastic conferences around the world and fund 
  the continued development of open source data-related libraries.

* [Continuum Analytics](http://continuum.io/) is one of the leading Python
  companies that pours a tremendous amount of time and funding into
  the data community.

* [A crash course in Python for scientists](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rpmuller/5920182)
  provides an overview of the Python language with iPython Notebook for those 
  in scientific fields.

* The videos of Travis Oliphant on 
  [Python's Role in Big Data Analytics: Past, Present, and Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXRvpBJ-Dkc)
  and 
  [Building the PyData Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9Qm3PPoYNQ)
  give historical perspective on how the Python data tools
  have evolved over the past 20ish years based on his first-hand experience
  as a leader and member in that community.
