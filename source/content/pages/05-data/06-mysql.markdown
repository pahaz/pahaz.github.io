# MySQL
MySQL is an open source [relational database](/databases.html) 
implementation for storing and retrieving data.

## MySQL or PostgreSQL?
MySQL is a viable open source database implementation for Python web 
applications. MySQL has a slightly easier initial learning curve than 
[PostgreSQL](/postgresql.html). However, PostgreSQL's design is often 
preferred by Python web developers, especially when data migrations are
run as an application evolves.

## Python Drivers for MySQL 
Accessing MySQL from a Python application requires a database driver (also
called a "connector"). While it is possible to write a driver as part of
your application, in practice most developers use an existing open source 
driver.

There was a major issue with MySQL drivers since the introduction of 
Python 3. One of the most popular libraries called 
[MySQLdb](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.5) did not work
in its existing form with Python 3 and there were no plans to update it.
Therefore a fork of MySQLdb named 
[mysqlclient](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mysqlclient) added Python 3
compatibility. 

The mysqlclient fork was good in that existing MySQLdb users could drop
mysqlclient into existing projects that were upgrading to Python 3. However,
the fork often causes confusion when searching for which Python driver to
use with MySQL. Many developer simply decide to use 
[PostgreSQL](/postgresql.html) because there is better support for Python
drivers in the PostgreSQL community. 

With that driver support context in mind, it's absolutely possible to build
a Python 3 web application with MySQL as a backend. Here is a list of
drivers along with whether it supports Python 2, 3 or both.

* [mysqlclient](https://mysqlclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a fork
  of MySQLdb that supports Python 2 and 3.

* [MySQL Connector](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/)
  is Oracle's "official" (Oracle currently owns MySQL) Python connector.
  The driver supports Python 2 and 3, just make sure to check the 
  [version guide](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/) for what
  releases work with which Python versions.

* [MySQLdb](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.5) supports
  Python 2 and was frequently used by Python web applications before the
  mass migration to Python 3 began.

* [PyMySQL](https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL) is a pure Python 
  (no C low-level code) implementation that attempts to be a drop-in
  replacement for MySQLdb. However, some MySQL APIs are not supported
  by the driver so whether or not your application can use this connector
  will depend on what you're building.


## What organizations use MySQL?
The database is deployed in production at some of the highest 
trafficked sites such as 
[Twitter](https://blog.twitter.com/2012/mysql-twitter), 
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/mysql-and-database-engineering-mark-callaghan/10150599729938920)
and [many others major organizations](http://www.mysql.com/customers/).
However, since
[MySQL AB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL_AB), the company that 
developed MySQL, was purchased by Sun Microsystems (which was in turn 
purchased by Oracle), there have been major defections away from the 
database by 
[Wikipedia](http://www.zdnet.com/wikipedia-moving-from-mysql-to-mariadb-7000008912/) 
and [Google](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/14/google-waves-goodbye-to-mysql-in-favor-of-mariadb). 
MySQL remains a viable database option but I always recommend new Python 
developers learn PostgreSQL if they do not already know MySQL.
