# PostgreSQL
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), often written as "Postgres" and 
pronounced "Poss-gres", is an open source
[relational database](/databases.html) implementation frequently used by 
Python applications as a backed for data storage and retrieval.

## How does PostgreSQL fit within the Python stack?
PostgreSQL is the default database choice for many Python developers, 
including the Django team when testing the 
[Django ORM](/object-relational-mappers-orms.html). PostgreSQL is often
viewed as more feature robust and stable when compared to MySQL, SQLServer 
and Oracle. All of those databases are reasonable choices. However, because 
PostgreSQL tends to be used by Python developers the drivers and example
code for using the database tend to be better documented and contain fewer
bugs for typical usage scenarios. If you try to use an Oracle database with
Django, you'll see there is far less example code for that setup compared
to PostgreSQL backend setups.

## Why is PostgreSQL a good database choice?
PostgreSQL's open source license allows developers to operate one or
more databases without licensing cost in their applications. The open 
source license operating model is much less expensive compared to Oracle 
or other proprietary databases, especially as replication and sharding
become necessary at large scale. In addition, because so many people 
ranging from independent developers to multinational organizations use 
PostgreSQL, it's often easier to find developers with PostgreSQL experience 
than other relational databases.

The PostgreSQL core team also releases frequent updates that greatly enhance 
the database's capabilities. For example, in the 
[PostgreSQL 9.4 release](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/release-9-4.html)
the [jsonb type](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/datatype-json.html)
was added to enhance JavaScript Object Notation ([JSON](http://www.json.org/))
storage capabilities so that in many cases a separate 
[NoSQL database](/no-sql-datastore.html) is not required in an application's
architecture.


## Connecting to PostgreSQL with Python
To work with relational databases in Python you need to use a database 
driver, which is also referred to as a database connector. The most common 
driver library for working with PostgreSQL is 
[psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/). There is 
[a list of all drivers on the PostgreSQL wiki](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Python),
including several libraries that are no longer maintained. If you're
working with the 
[asyncio Python stdlib module](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio.html) 
you should also take a look at the 
[aiopg](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiopg) library which
wraps psycopg2's asychronouos features together.

To abstract the connection between tables and objects, many Python 
developers use an 
[object-relational mapper (ORM)](/object-relational-mappers-orms.html) with 
to turn relational data from PostgreSQL into objects that can be used in
their Python application. For example, while PostgreSQL provides a 
relational database and psycopg is the common database connector, there
are many ORMs that can be used with varying web frameworks, as shown in the
table below.

Learn more about 
[Python ORMs on that dedicated topic page](/object-relational-mappers-orms.html).


## PostgreSQL data safety
If you're on Linux it's easy to get PostgreSQL installed using a package manager.
However, once the database is installed and running your responsibility is just beginning.
Before you go live with a production application, make sure to:

1. Lock down access with 
   [a whitelist](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html) 
   in the `pg_hba.conf` file 
1. Enable [replication](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-master-slave-replication-on-postgresql-on-an-ubuntu-12-04-vps)
   to another database that's preferrably on different infrastructure in 
   a separate location
1. Perform regular 
   [backups and test the restoration process](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/backup.html)
1. Ensure your application prevents 
   [SQL injection attacks](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection)

When possible have someone qualified do a 
[PostgreSQL security audit](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/2517/postgresql-security-audit)
to identify the biggest risks to your database. Small applications and 
bootstrapped companies often cannot afford a full audit in the beginning but
as an application grows over time it becomes a bigger target.

The data stored in your database is the lifeblood of your application. If you have
ever 
[accidentally dropped a production database](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/02/introducing-developer-evangelist-matt-makai.html) 
or been the victim of malicious activity such as SQL injection attacks, you'll
know it's far easier to recover when a bit of work has been performed 
beforehand on backups, replication and security measures.


## Python-specific PostgreSQL resources
Many quickstarts and tutorials exist specifically for Django, Flask and 
other web application frameworks. The ones below are some of the best
walkthroughs I've read.
