# Bottle
[Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html) is a WSGI-compliant
[single source file](https://github.com/defnull/bottle/blob/master/bottle.py)
web framework with no external dependencies other than the Python
[standard library (stdlib)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/).

## Should I use Bottle for web development?
Bottle is awesome for a few web development situations:

1. Prototyping ideas 
1. Learning how web frameworks are built
1. Building and running simple personal web applications 

#### Prototyping
Prototyping simple ideas is often easier with Bottle than a more
opinionated web framework like [Django](/django.html) because Django
projects start with a significant amount of boilerplate code. The
[Model-View-Template](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/faq/general/#django-appears-to-be-a-mvc-framework-but-you-call-the-controller-the-view-and-the-view-the-template-how-come-you-don-t-use-the-standard-names)
structure for Django apps within projects makes maintaining projects
easier, but it can be cumbersome on starter projects where you're
just playing with random ideas so you aren't worried about your 
application's long-term code structure.

#### Learning about frameworks
Bottle is contained 
[within a single large source file](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle/blob/master/bottle.py) 
named `bottle.py` so it provides great reading when learning how 
[WSGI](/wsgi-servers.html) web frameworks work. Everything you need to learn 
about how your web application's code connects with the Bottle framework is 
contained within that single source code.

#### Personal projects
Personal projects can be deployed with Bottle as the only dependency.
If you've never performed a [Python web app deployment](/deployment.html)
before, the number of concepts and steps can be daunting. By packaging
`bottle.py` with your app's source code, you can skip some of the
steps to more easily get your web application up and running.

## Bottle framework learning checklist
1. [Download Bottle](https://github.com/defnull/bottle/raw/master/bottle.py)
   or install via pip with ``pip install bottle`` on your local development
   machine.

1. Work through the official
   [Bottle tutorial](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial.html).

1. Start coding your Bottle app based on what you learned in the official
   tutorial plus reading open source example applications found above.

1. Move on to the [deployment section](/deployment.html) to get your initial
   Bottle application on the web.
