# Flask
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a Python web framework built with a 
[small core and easy-to-extend philosophy](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/design/).

## Why is Flask a good web framework choice?
Flask is considered more 
[Pythonic](http://blog.startifact.com/posts/older/what-is-pythonic.html)
than Django because Flask web application code is in most cases more explicit. 
Flask is easy to get started with as a beginner because there is little 
boilerplate code for getting a simple app up and running. 

For example, here's a valid "hello world" web application with Flask (the
equivalent in Django would be significantly more code):

    from flask import Flask
    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def hello_world():
        return 'Hello World!'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run()

Flask was also written several years after Django and therefore
learned from the Python community's reactions as the framework evolved.
Jökull Sólberg wrote a great piece articulating to this effect in his 
[experience switching between Flask and Django](http://jokull.calepin.co/my-flask-to-django-experience.html).

## Flask framework learning checklist
1. [Install Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/installation/) on
   your local development machine.

1. Work through the 18-part Flask tutorial listed first under "Flask 
   resources" above.
 
1. Read through 
   [Flask Extensions Registry](http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/) to find 
   out what extensions you'll need to build your project.

1. Start coding your Flask app based on what you learned from the 18 part
   Flask tutorial plus open source example applications found below. 

1. Move on to the [deployment section](/deployment.html) to get your initial 
   Flask project on the web.
