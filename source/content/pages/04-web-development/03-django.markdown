# Django
[Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) is a widely-used Python web 
application framework with a "batteries-included" philosophy. The principle
behind batteries-included is that the common functionality for building
web applications should come with the framework instead of as separate
libraries.


<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" style="border: none;"><img src="/img/django-logo-positive.png" width="100%" alt="Official Django logo. Trademark Django Software Foundation." class="technical-diagram" /></a>


For example, 
[authentication](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/),
[URL routing](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/urls/), a 
[templating system](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/),
an [object-relational mapper](/object-relational-mappers-orms.html) (ORM),
and [database schema migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/migrations/)
(as of version 1.7) are all included with the [Django framework](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django/). 
Compare that included functionality to the Flask framework which requires a 
separate library such as 
[Flask-Login](https://flask-login.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
to perform user authentication. 

The batteries-included and extensibility philosophies are simply two different
ways to tackle framework building. Neither philosophy is inherently better 
than the other one.

## Why is Django a good web framework choice?
The Django project's stability, performance and community have grown 
tremendously over the past decade since the framework's creation. Detailed
tutorials and good practices are readily available on the web and in books.
The framework continues to add significant new functionality such as 
[database migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/migrations/)
with each release. 

I highly recommend the Django framework as a starting place for new Python web 
developers because the official documentation and tutorials are some of the 
best anywhere in software development. Many cities also have Django-specific
groups such as [Django District](http://www.meetup.com/django-district/),
[Django Boston](http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/) and 
[San Francisco Django](http://www.meetup.com/The-San-Francisco-Django-Meetup-Group/) 
so new developers can get help when they are stuck.

There's some debate on whether 
[learning Python by using Django is a bad idea](http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/12/11/learning-python-via-django-considered-harmful/). 
However, that criticism is invalid if you take the time to learn the Python
syntax and language semantics first before diving into web development.


## Django books and tutorials
There are a slew of free or low cost resources out there for Django. Since
Django was released over 10 years ago and has had a huge number of updates
since then, when you're looking for an up-to-date Django book check out the
list below or read this post showing [current Django books](http://twoscoopspress.org/pages/current-django-books)
as of Django 1.8, 1.9.

* [Test-Driven Development with Python](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/) 
  focuses on web development using Django and JavaScript. This book uses 
  the development of a website using the Django web framework as a real
  world example of how to perform test-driven development (TDD). There is
  also coverage of NoSQL, websockets and asynchronous responses. The book can
  be read online for free or purchased in hard copy via O'Reilly.

* [Tango with Django](http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/) is an extensive 
  set of free introductions to using the most popular Python web framework. 
  Several current developers said this book really helped them get over the 
  initial framework learning curve. It's recently been updated for Django 1.7!

* The [Django Girls Tutorial](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/index.html)

  from scratch?”

* This Django tutorial shows how to 
  [build a project from scratch using Twitter Bootstrap, Bower, Requests and the Github API](http://drksephy.github.io/2015/07/16/django/).

* The [recommended Django project layout](http://www.revsys.com/blog/2014/nov/21/recommended-django-project-layout/)
  is helpful for developers new to Django to understand how to structure
  the directories and files within apps for projects.

* This [Python Social Auth for Django tutorial](https://github.com/davisfreeman1015/SocialAuthDjangoTutorial)
  will show you how to integrate social media sign in buttons into your Django
  application.

* Luke Plant writes about 
  [his approach to class based views](http://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/my-approach-to-class-based-views/) (CBVs),
  which often provoke heated debate in the Django community for whether they
  are a time saver or "too much magic" for the framework.

* [How to serve Django apps with uWSGI and Nginx on Ubuntu 14.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-django-applications-with-uwsgi-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04)

  material for understanding what's changed in this major release and
  how to adapt your Django project.

## Channels in 1.9+
Channels are a new mechanism in Django 1.9 (as a standalone app, later
for incorporation into the core framework in 1.10) for real-time 
full-duplex communication between the browser and the server based on 
[WebSockets](/websockets.html). 
  
* This 
  [tutorial shows how to get started with Django Channels in your project](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2016/3/17/in_deep_with_django_channels_the_future_of_real_time_apps_in_django).

* The 
  [channels examples repository](https://github.com/andrewgodwin/channels-examples)
  contains a couple of good starter projects such as a live blog and a 
  chat application to use as base code.

* Channnels currently use Django's existing authentication scheme, but
  this blog post [JSON Web Tokens authentication on Django Channels](http://www.machinalis.com/blog/jwt-django-channels/)
  shows how to use a custom [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/)
  implementation in Django Channels instead.

* [Offloading work using Django Channels](http://www.machinalis.com/blog/offloading-work-using-django-channels/)
  is a short post that builds on a previous example to add a shared 
  canvas with group updates via Channels, which would otherwise be difficult 
  to accomplish in a Django web app without a persistent data transfer
  mechanism.


## Django testing
* [Integrating Front End Tools with Django](https://lincolnloop.com/blog/integrating-front-end-tools-your-django-project/)
  is a good post to read for figuring out how to use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
  for handling front end tools in development and production Django sites.

## Django ORM resources
Django comes with its own custom object-relational mapper (ORM) typically
referred to as "the Django ORM". Learn more about the Django ORM on the
[Python object-relational mappers page](/object-relational-mappers-orms.html) 
that includes a section specifically for the Django ORM as well as additional
resources and tutorials.


## Static and media files
Deploying and handling static and media files can be confusing for new
Django developers. These resources along with the 
[static content](/static-content.html) page are useful for figuring out how 
to handle these files properly.

## Django learning checklist
1. [Install Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/) on
   your local development machine.

1. Work through the initial 
   ["polls" tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/).
 
1. Build a few more simple applications using the tutorial resources found
   in the "Django resources" section.

1. Start coding your own Django project with help from the 
   [official documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/) and 
   resource links below. You'll make plenty of mistakes which is critical
   on your path to learning the right way to build applications.

1. Read [2 Scoops of Django](http://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-Best-Practices/dp/0981467342) 
   to understand Django good practices and learn better ways of building 
   Django web applications.

1. Move on to the [deployment section](/deployment.html) to get your Django 
   project on the web.
