# Web Development
Web development is the umbrella term for conceptualizing, creating, 
[deploying](/deployment.html) and operating web applications and 
[application programming interfaces](/application-programming-interfaces.html)
for the Web.


## Why is web development important?
The Web has grown a mindboggling amount in the number of sites, users and
implementation capabilities since the 
[first website](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) went live
in [1989](http://home.cern/topics/birth-web). Web development is the concept
that encompasses all the activities involved with websites and web 
applications.

## How does Python fit into web development?
Python can be used to build server-side web applications. While a
[web framework](/web-frameworks.html) is not required to build web apps,
it's rare that developers would not use existing open source libraries to
speed up their progress in getting their application working.

Python is not used in a web browser. The language executed in browsers
such as Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer is 
[JavaScript](/javascript.html). Projects such as [pyjs](http://pyjs.org/) 
can compile from Python to JavaScript. However, most Python developers are 
write their web applications in a combination of Python, which is executed
on the server side and JavaScript, which is downloaded to the web browser
client and executed there.


### Web development resources
* [Web application development is different and better](http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/01/web-application-development-is-different-and-better.html)
  provides some context for how web development has evolved from writing
  static HTML files into the complex JavaScript client-side applications
  produced today.

* While not Python-specific, Mozilla put together a 
  [Learning the Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn) tutorial
  for beginners and intermediate web users who want to build websites.
  It's worth a look for general web development learning.

* The [Evolution of the Web](http://www.evolutionoftheweb.com/) visualizes 
  how web browsers and related technologies have changed over time as well as
  the overall growth of the Internet in the amount of data transferred. Note 
  that the visualization unfortunately stops around the beginning of 2013 but
  it's a good way to explore what happened in the first 24 years.

* Web development involves HTTP communication between the server, hosting
  a website or web application, and the client, a web browser. Knowing
  how web browsers works is important as a developer, so take a look at
  this article on 
  [what's in a web browser](https://medium.com/@camaelon/what-s-in-a-web-browser-83793b51df6c).

* [Three takeaways for web developers after two weeks of painfully slow Internet](https://medium.com/@zengabor/three-takeaways-for-web-developers-after-two-weeks-of-painfully-slow-internet-9e7f6d47726e)
  is a must-read for every web developer. Not everyone has fast Internet
  service, whether because they are in a remote part of the world or they're
  just in a subway tunnel. Optimizing sites so they work in those situations
  is important for keeping your users happy.
