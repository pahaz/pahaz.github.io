# Python Programming Language
The Python programming language is an 
[open source](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/), 
[widely-used](/why-use-python.html) tool for 
creating software applications.


## What is Python used for?
Python is often used to [build](/web-frameworks.html) and [deploy](/deployment.html) 
[web applications](/web-development.html) and 
[web APIs](/application-programming-interfaces.html). Python
can also analyze and visualize [data](/data.html) 
and [test software](/testing.html), even if the software being
tested was not written in Python.


## General Python language resources
* The [online Python tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/) visually walks
  through code and shows how it executes on the Python interpreter.

* [Python Module of the Week](http://pymotw.com/2/index.html) is a tour
  through the Python standard library.

* [A Python interpreter written in Python](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-python-interpreter-written-in-python.html)
  is incredibly meta but really useful for wrapping your head around some
  of the lower level stuff going on in the language.

* [A few things to remember while coding in Python](http://satyajit.ranjeev.in/2012/05/17/python-a-few-things-to-remember.html)
  is a nice collection of good practices to use while building programs
  with the language. 

* [Python internals: adding a new statement to Python](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2010/06/30/python-internals-adding-a-new-statement-to-python/)

* [Python tricks that you can't live without](http://www.slideshare.net/audreyr/python-tricks-that-you-cant-live-without)
  is a slideshow by Audrey Roy that goes over code readability, linting,
  dependency isolation, and other good Python practices.

* [Python innards introduction](http://tech.blog.aknin.name/2010/04/02/pythons-innards-introduction/)
  explains how some of Python's internal execution happens.

* [What is a metaclass in Python](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/100003/what-is-a-metaclass-in-python)
  is one of the best Stack Overflow answers about Python.

* Armin Roacher presented [things you didn't know about Python](https://speakerdeck.com/mitsuhiko/didntknow)
  at PyCon South Africa in 2012.

* [Writing idiomatic Python](http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/10/04/writing-idiomatic-python/)
  is a guide for writing Pythonic code.

* [The thing that runs your Python](http://ashfall.github.io/blog/2012/10/23/the-thing-that-runs-your-python/)
  is a summary of what one developer learned about PyPy while researching it. 


## Python ecosystem resources
There's an entire page on [best Python resources](/best-python-resources.html)
with links but the following resources are a better fit for when you're past 
the very beginner topics.

* [The Python Ecosystem: An Introduction](http://mirnazim.org/writings/python-ecosystem-introduction/)
  provides context for virtual machines, Python packaging, pip, virtualenv
  and many other topics after learning the basic Python syntax. 

* The [Python Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/python) rolls up great
  Python links and has an active community ready to answer questions from
  beginners and advanced Python developers alike.

* The blog [Free Python Tips](http://freepythontips.wordpress.com/) provides
  posts on Python topics as well as news for the Python ecosystem.

* [Python Books](http://pythonbooks.revolunet.com/) is a collection of freely
  available books on Python, Django, and data analysis.

* [Python IAQ: Infrequently Asked Questions](http://norvig.com/python-iaq.html)
  is a list of quirky queries on rare Python features and why certain syntax
  was or was not built into the language.

* [A practical introduction to Functional Programming for Python coders](https://codesachin.wordpress.com/2016/04/03/a-practical-introduction-to-functional-programming-for-python-coders/)
  is a good starter for developers looking to learn the functional 
  programming paradigm side of the language.

* [Getting Started with the Python Internals](http://akaptur.com/blog/2014/08/03/getting-started-with-python-internals/)
  takes a slice of the huge CPython codebase and deconstructs some of
  it to see what we can learn about how Python itself is built.
