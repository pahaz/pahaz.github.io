meta: Docker is a container management system often used for deploying web applications. Learn more about Docker on Full Stack Python.


# Docker
Docker is an [open source](https://github.com/docker/docker) 
infrastructure management platform for running and deploying software. The
Docker platform is constantly evolving so an exact definition is currently
a moving target.


## Why is Docker important?
Docker can package up applications along with their necessary operating system
dependencies for easier deployment across environments. In the long run it
has the potential to be the abstraction layer that easily manages containers
running on top of any type of server, regardless of whether that server is
on Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine, Linode, Rackspace or elsewhere.


## Python projects within Docker images
* This Docker image contains 
  [a Flask application configured to run with uWSGI and Nginx](https://github.com/tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask-docker).
  You can also see the [image on Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask/).

* [minimal-docker-python-setup](https://github.com/OrangeTux/minimal-docker-python-setup) 
  contains an image with Nginx, uWSGI, Redis and Flask.
