# DevOps
DevOps is the combination of application development and operations, which
minimizes or eliminates the disconnect between software developers who build 
applications and systems administrators who keep infrastructure running.


## Why is DevOps important?
When the Agile methodology is properly used to develop software a new
bottleneck often appears during the [deployment](/deployment.html) and 
operations phases. New updates and fixes are produced so fast in each 
sprint that infrastructure teams can be overwhelmed with deployments and 
push back on the pace of delivery. To allievate some of these issues, 
application developers are asked to work closely with operations folks to
automate the delivery from development to production. 


## General DevOps resources
* [DevOps vs. Platform Engineering](https://alexgaynor.net/2015/mar/06/devops-vs-platform-engineering/)
  considers DevOps an ad hoc approach to developing software while building
  a platform is a strict contract. I see this as "DevOps is a process", 
  while a "platform is code". Running code is better than any organizational 
  process.

* [DevOps: Python tools to get started](https://speakerdeck.com/victorneo/devops-python-tools-to-get-started)
  is a presentation slideshow that explains that while DevOps is a culture, 
  it can be supported by tools such as Fabric, Jenkins, BuildBot and Git
  which when used properly can enable continuous software delivery.

* [Why are we racing to DevOps?](http://www.cio.com/article/3015237/application-development/why-are-we-racing-to-devops.html)
  is a very high level summary of the benefits of DevOps to IT organizations.
  It's not specific to Python and doesn't dive into the details, but it's 
  a decent start for figuring out why IT organizations consider DevOps the
  hot new topic after adopting an Agile development methodology.
