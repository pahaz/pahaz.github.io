meta: Debugging involves instrumenting, isolating and hunting defects in running code. Learn more about debugging on Full Stack Python.


# Debugging
Developers often find themselves in situations where the code they've written
is not working quite right. When that happens, a developer debugs their code
by instrumenting, executing and inspecting the code to determine what state
of the application does not match the assumptions of how the code should
be correctly running.


## Why is debugging important?
There are bugs in every modest sized or larger application. Every 
developer has to learn how to debug code in order to write programs that
work as correctly as time and budget allow.


### Debugging resources
* [Debugging your Python code](http://howchoo.com/g/zgi2y2iwyze/debugging-your-python-code)
  walks through a scenario where 
  [pdb](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pdb.html) 
  can be used to find a defect in a block of Python code.

* [pdb - Interactive Debugger](https://pymotw.com/2/pdb/) is featured on
  the Python Module of the Week blog and has some great detail on using
  the program effectively.

* [Python debugging tools](http://blog.ionelmc.ro/2013/06/05/python-debugging-tools/)
  provides a list of tools such as pdb and its derivatives ipdb, pudb and
  pdb++ along with how they can be used in the hunt for defects.

* [Debugging in Python](https://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2009/09/10/debugging-in-python/)
  elaborates on what pdb does and how it can be used.
