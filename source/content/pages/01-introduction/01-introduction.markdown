# Introduction
You're knee deep in learning the [Python](http://www.python.org/)
programming language. The syntax is starting to make sense. The first
few "*ahh-ha*!" moments hit you as you learning conditional
statements, `for` loops and classes while playing around with the open source 
libraries that make Python such an amazing language.

Now you want to take your initial Python knowledge and make something real,
like an application that's available on the web that you can show off or 
sell as a service to other people. That's where Full Stack Python comes in. 
You've come to the right place to learn everything you need to create, deploy 
and run a production Python web application.
