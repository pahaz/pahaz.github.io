# Best Python Videos
If you prefer to learn Python programming by watching videos then this is the
resource for you. I've watched hundreds of live technical talks and combed
through videos to pick out the ones with great speakers who'll teach you the
most about the language and ecosystem. 

This page links to the best free videos as well as other video lists so you 
can do your own searching through the huge backlog of conference and meetup 
talks from the past several years. 

<div class="well see-also">Be sure to read the <a href="/best-python-resources.html">best Python resources</a> for links to books and articles as well as <a href="/web-frameworks.html">web frameworks</a> to learn more about web development.</div>


## Live Coding
Learn by watching developers code. Follow my account on 
[Twitch Creative](https://www.twitch.tv/mattmakai) then enable 
email alerts when I go live. On Wednesdays I code Python and Swift 
applications, answering any chat questions along the way.
I also hold office hours on Fridays where you can drop in and ask 
questions about your coding issues.


## Web development with Django, Flask and other frameworks
* [Kate Heddleston](https://twitter.com/heddle317) gave a talk at PyCon 2014 
  called 
  "[Full-stack Python Web Applications](http://pyvideo.org/video/2591/so-you-want-to-be-a-full-stack-developer-how-to)"
  with clear visuals for how numerous layers of the Python web
  stack fit together. There are also [slides available from the talk](https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2014/so-you-want-to-be-a-full-stack-developer-how-to-build-a-full-stack-python-web-application-by-kate-heddleston)
  with all the diagrams.

* My [EuroPython 2014 "Full Stack Python"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6NaOKD40rY)
  talk goes over each topic from this guide and provides context for how the
  pieces fit together. 
  The [talk slides](http://www.mattmakai.com/presentations/2014-full-stack-python-berlin.html) are also available.

* Kate Heddleston and I gave a talk at DjangoCon 2014 called
  [Choose Your Own Django Deployment Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrFEKghISEI)
  which walked through many of the scenarios you'd face when deploying your
  first Django website.

* The [Discover Flask](https://github.com/realpython/discover-flask) series is
  a detailed Flask tutorial on video with corresponding code examples on 
  GitHub.

* [Designing Django's Migrations](http://pyvideo.org/video/2630/designing-djangos-migrations)
  covers Django 1.7's new migrations from the main programmer 
  of South and now Django's built-in migrations, Andrew Godwin.

* [GoDjango](https://godjango.com/) screencasts and tutorials are free short
  videos for learning how to build Django applications.

* The videos and slides from 
  [Django: Under the Hood 2015](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9T1dhIlL_8Va9DxvKRowBw)
  are from Django core committers and provide insight into the ORM, 
  internationalization, templates and other important 
  [web framework](/web-frameworks.html) topics.

* DjangoCon US videos from 
  [2014](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7tQUdRKcybbNiuhLcc3h6WzmZGVBMr3), 
  [2013](http://www.youtube.com/user/TheOpenBastion/videos), 
  [2012](http://pyvideo.org/category/23/djangocon-2012), 
  [2011](http://pyvideo.org/category/3/djangocon-2011), as well as  
  [earlier US and DjangoCon EU conferences](http://pyvideo.org/category) are
  all available free of charge.

* DjangoCon EU videos are also available from 
  [2015](https://vimeo.com/channels/952478/videos).


## Core Python language videos
* Jessica McKellar's 
  [Building and breaking a Python sandbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL_syMmRkoU)
  is a fascinating walk through the lower layers of the Python interpreter.

* Brandon Rhodes' 
  [All Your Ducks In A Row: Data Structures in the Std Lib and Beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYlnfvKVDoM)
  goes through how data structures are implemented, how to select a
  data structure appropriate to your application and how the list and 
  dictionary can be used in many situations.

* The talk [Python Descriptors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdvpNaWwx24) 
  by Simeon Franklin explains the what and why of this core Python language 
  feature.

* David Beazley gives an amazing live coded performance to show
  [Python concurrency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCs5OvhV9S4)
  using threads, event loops and coroutines. David makes the live coding
  look easy but a whole lot of work must've gone into that talk.


## Screencasts and class recordings
* [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) contains
  lecture videos and exercises for learning Python.

* While there aren't always live streams online, it's worth checking out the 
  [Python category on Livecoding.tv](https://www.livecoding.tv/livestreams/python/) 
  to see if anyone is streaming or has a recording of working on a Python 
  project. Even experienced developers can learn a whole lot from watching 
  other developer's work on their projects. I also stream a couple times per
  week so if you 
  [follow me on my username](https://www.livecoding.tv/mattmakai/) you'll 
  get an alert when I go online.


## Video compilations
* [PyVideo](http://www.pyvideo.org/) organizes and indexes thousands of Python
  videos from both major conferences and meetups.

* [Incredible Technical Speakers](https://github.com/mattmakai/incredible-technical-speakers)
  is a repository I put together that features software developer speakers
  talking about programming language agnostic topics. The list is intended
  to emphasize professional software developers who also have the ability to
  engage an audience of peers with an exciting talk.
