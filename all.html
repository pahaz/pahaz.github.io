          <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>You're knee deep in learning the <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
programming language. The syntax is starting to make sense. The first
few "<em>ahh-ha</em>!" moments hit you as you learning conditional
statements, <code>for</code> loops and classes while playing around with the open source 
libraries that make Python such an amazing language.</p>
<p>Now you want to take your initial Python knowledge and make something real,
like an application that's available on the web that you can show off or 
sell as a service to other people. That's where Full Stack Python comes in. 
You've come to the right place to learn everything you need to create, deploy 
and run a production Python web application.</p>
          <h1>Learning Programming</h1>
<p>Learning to program is about understanding how to translate thoughts into 
source code that can be executed on computers to achieve one or more goals.</p>
<p>There are many steps in learning how to program, including</p>
<ol>
<li>setting up a <a href="/development-environments.html">development environment</a></li>
<li>selecting a programming language, such as Python</li>
<li>understanding the syntax and commands for the language</li>
<li>writing code in the language, often using 
   <a href="/application-dependencies.html">pre-existing code libraries</a> and 
   <a href="/web-frameworks.html">frameworks</a></li>
<li>executing the program</li>
<li>debugging errors and unexpected results</li>
<li><a href="/deployment.html">deploying</a> an application so it can run for intended 
   users</li>
</ol>
<h2>How should I learn programming?</h2>
<p>There are several schools of thought on how a person should start learning
to program. One school of thought is that a lower-level programming
language such as Assembly or C are the most appropriate languages to start
with because they force new developers to write their own data structures, 
learn about pointers and generally work their way through the hard problems 
in computer science.</p>
<p>There's certainly wisdom in this "low-level first" philosophy because it 
forces a beginner to gain a strong foundation before moving on to higher
level topics such as web and mobile application development. This philosophy 
is the one most commonly used in university computer science programs.</p>
<p>The atomic units of progress in the "low-level first" method of learning are </p>
<ol>
<li>aspects of programming language understood (type systems, syntax)</li>
<li>number of data structures coded and able to be used (stacks, queues)</li>
<li>algorithms in a developer's toolbelt (quicksort, binary search)</li>
</ol>
<p>Another school of thought is that new developers should bootstrap
themselves through working on projects in whatever programming language 
interests them enough to keep working through the frustrations that will
undoubtably occur.</p>
<p>In this "project-based" line of thinking, the number of projects completed 
that expand a programmer's abilities are the units of progress. Extra value 
is placed on making the projects open source and working with experienced 
mentors to learn what he or she can improve on in their programs. </p>
<h2>Should I learn Python first?</h2>
<p>Python is good choice in the project-based approach because of the extensive 
availability of 
<a href="/best-python-resources.html">free and low cost introductory resources</a>,
many of which provide example projects to build upon.</p>
<p>Note that this question of whether or not Python is a good first language
for an aspiring programmer is highly subjective and these approaches are
not mutually exclusive. Python is also widely taught in universities to 
explain the fundamental concepts in computer science, which is in line 
with the "low-level first" philosophy than the projects-first method.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, whether Python is the right first programming language to 
learn is up to your own learning style and what feels right. If Ruby or Java
seem like they are easier to learn than Python, go for those languages.
Programming languages, and the ecosystems around them, are human-made 
constructs. Find one that appears to match your personal style and give it a
try, knowing that whatever you choose you'll need to put in many long days and
nights to really get comfortable as a software developer.</p>
          <h1>Why Use Python?</h1>
<p>Python's expansive library of open source data analysis tools, 
<a href="/web-frameworks.html">web frameworks</a>, 
and testing instruments make its ecosystem one of the largest out of any 
programming community. </p>
<p>Python is an accessible language for new programmers because the community
provides many <a href="/best-python-resources.html">introductory resources</a>. The
language is also widely taught in universities and used for working with 
beginner-friendly devices such as the 
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>
<div class="well see-also">If you're learning about why to use Python you should also take a look at <a href="/best-python-resources.html">the best Python resources</a> and read <a href="/what-full-stack-means.html">what "full stack" means</a>.</div>

<h2>Python's programming language popularity</h2>
<p>Several programming language popularity rankings exist. While it's
possible to criticize that these guides are not exact, every ranking shows 
Python as a top programming language within the top ten, if not the top five
of all languages.  </p>
<p>The IEEE ranked <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2016-top-programming-languages">Python as the #3 top programming language</a>
in 2016, while
<a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2015/01/14/language-rankings-1-15/">RedMonk's January 2015 ranking</a> had Python at #4.</p>
<p>The 
<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">TIOBE Index</a>,
a long-running language ranking, has Python steady at #8. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html">PopularitY of Programming Language</a> 
(PYPL), based on leading indicators from Google Trends search keyword 
analysis, shows Python at #3.</p>
<p><a href="http://githut.info/">GitHut</a>, a visualization of GitHub language popularity, 
pegs Python at #3 overall as well.</p>
<p>These rankings provide a rough measure for language popularity. They are not 
intended as a precise measurement tool to determine exactly how many 
developers are using a language. However, the aggregate view shows that Python 
remains a stable programming language with a growing ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Why does the choice of programming language matter?</h2>
<p>Programming languages have unique ecosystems, cultures and philosophies
built around them. You will find friction with a community and difficulty 
in learning if your approach to programming varies from the philosophy of 
the programming language you've selected.</p>
<p>Python's culture values 
<a href="https://github.com/trending?l=python&amp;since=monthly">open source software</a>, 
community involvement with 
<a href="http://www.pycon.org/">local, national and international events</a> and
teaching to new programmers. If those values are also important to you and/or
your organization then Python may be a good fit. </p>
<p>The philosophy for Python is so strongly held that it's even embedded in
the language as shown when the interpreter executes "import this" and
displays <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">The Zen of Python</a>.</p>

  provides a viewpoint from someone who is not a professional developer but
  uses coding to hack out some projects. He found Microsoft's .NET ecosystem
  lacking when it came to satisfying his needs and Python filled the gap for
  him with its wide array of open source code libraries, package management
  and ability to work well on platforms other than Windows.</p>

</ul>
          <h1>Python 2 or 3?</h1>
<p>The Python programming language is currently in the midst of a long-term
transition from version 2 to version 3. New programmers typically have many
questions about which version they should learn. It's confusing to hear
that Python 3, which was originally released in 2008, is still not the default
installation on many operating systems.</p>
<p>Here's the good news: you can't go wrong starting with either version. While 
there are differences in unicode and syntax, for the most part if you 
start with Python 2 and then learn Python 3 you won't be starting from 
scratch. Likewise, you'll be able to read and write Python 2 code if you 
started with Python 3.</p>
<p>My personal recommendation for new programmers as of right now is to use
Python 3. There are enough <a href="/best-python-resources.html">great resources</a>
out there that teach version 3 from the ground up. Python 3 is the future
and you will not regret starting with the "correct" version of the
programming language.</p>
<p>However, if you are interested in DevOps-type work with 
<a href="/configuration-management.html">configuration management tools</a> such as 
Ansible or Fabric, then you'll have to stick to Python 2 because they have
yet to upgrade to support Python 3. If you know there are libraries you must
use in a project, check the 
<a href="https://python3wos.appspot.com/">Python Walls of Superpowers</a>. If you're
using Django, there is also a wall specifically for 
<a href="http://djangowos.com/">Python 3 compatibility of popular Django packages</a>.</p>
<h3>Visualizations and Projects</h3>
<p>Since upgrading from Python 2 to 3 has been such a huge undertaking within
the community, many projects have sprung up to make the transition easier.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pythonhosted.org/six/">six</a> is a 2/3 compatibility library that
  is a dependency for many popular Python projects to make it easier to
  support both Python 2 and 3 at the same time.</p>

  which most popular 360 libraries (by downloads) are ready to be
  used with Python 3.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://pythonclock.org/">Python clock</a> counts down the time until
  Python 2.x is no longer maintained. While in 2016 Python 2's retirement
  may seem a long time away, it can take a lot of time and effort to migrate
  existing application to the modified syntax in 3.x.</p>

          <h1>Enterprise Python</h1>
<p>One of the misconceptions around Python and other dynamically-typed languages 
is that they cannot be reliably used to build enterprise-grade software. 
However, almost all commercial and government enterprises already use 
Python in some capacity, either as glue code between disparate applications 
or to build the applications themselves. </p>
<h2>What is enterprise software?</h2>
<p>Enterprise software is built for the requirements of an organization rather 
than the needs of an individual. Software written for enterprises often 
needs to integrate with legacy systems, such as existing databases and 
non-web applications. There are often requirements to integrate with 
authentication systems such as the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol">Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)</a> 
and 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa746492%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">Active Directory (AD)</a>.</p>
<p>Organizations develop enterprise software with numerous custom requirements 
to fit the specific needs of their operating model. Therefore the software
development process often becomes far more complicated due to disparate 
factions within an organization vying for the software to handle their 
needs at the expense of other factions.</p>
<p>The complexity due to the many stakeholders involved in the building of 
enterprise software leads to large budgets and extreme scrutiny by 
non-technical members of an organization. Typically those non-technical 
people place irrational emphasis on the choice of programming language and 
frameworks when otherwise they should not make technical design decisions.</p>
<h2>Why are there misconceptions about Python in enterprise environments?</h2>
<p>Traditionally large organizations building enterprise software have used 
statically typed languages such as C++, .NET and Java. Throughout the 1980s 
and 1990s large companies such as Microsoft, Sun Microsystems and Oracle 
marketed these languages as "enterprise grade". The inherent snub to other
languages was that they were not appropriate for CIOs' difficult technical 
environments. Languages other than Java, C++ and .NET were seen as risky and
therefore not worthy of investment.</p>
<p>In addition, "scripting languages" such as Python, Perl and Ruby were not
yet robust enough in the 1990s because their core standard libraries were
still being developed. Frameworks such as <a href="/django.html">Django</a>, 
<a href="/flask.html">Flask</a> and Rails (for Ruby) did not yet exist. The Web was
just beginning and most enterprise applications were desktop apps built
for Windows. Python simply wasn't made for such environments.</p>
<h2>Why is Python now appropriate for building enterprise software?</h2>
<p>From the early 2000s through today the languages and ecosystems for many
dynamically typed languages have greatly improved and often surpassed some
aspects of other ecosystems. Python, Ruby and other previously derided 
languages now have vast, well-maintained open source ecosystems backed by 
both independent developers and large companies including Microsoft, IBM, 
Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Twilio and many, many others.</p>
<p>Python's open source libraries, especially for
<a href="/web-frameworks.html">web development</a> and data analysis, are some of the 
best maintained and fully featured pieces of code for any language.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some of the traditional enterprise software development languages 
such as Java have languished due to underinvestment by their major corporate 
backers. When <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/018363">Oracle purchased Sun Microsystems in 2009</a>
there was a long lag time before Java was enhanced with new language features
in Java 7.  Oracle also 
<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/06/java-adware-mac/">bundles unwanted adware with the Java installation</a>,
whereas the Python community would never put up with such a situation because
the language is open source and does not have a single corporate controller.</p>
<p>Other ecosystems, such as the .NET platform by Microsoft have fared much 
better. Microsoft continued to invest in moving the .NET platform along
throughout the early part of the new millennium.</p>
<p>However, Microsoft's enterprise products often have expensive licensing fees 
for their application servers and associated software. In addition, Microsoft 
is also a major backer of open source, <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/OneOfMicrosoftsBestKeptSecretsPythonToolsForVisualStudioPTVS.aspx">especially Python</a>,
and their 
<a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/python-vs.aspx">Python tools for Visual Studio</a> 
provide a top-notch <a href="/development-environments.html">development environment</a>.</p>
<p>The end result is that enterprise software development has changed 
dramatically over the past couple of decades. CIOs and technical executives
can no longer ignore the progress of Python and the great open source 
community in the enterprise software development landscape if they want to

          <h1>Development Environments</h1>
<p>A development environment is a combination of a text editor and the Python
interpreter. The text editor allows you to write the code. The interpreter
provides a way to execute the code you've written. A text editor can be
as simple as Notepad on Windows or more complicated as a complete integrated
development environment (IDE) such as 
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> which runs on any major 
operating system.</p>
<h2>Why is a development environment necessary?</h2>
<p>Python code needs to be written, executed and tested to build
applications. The text editor provides a way to write the code. The 
interpreter allows it to be executed. Testing to see if the code does what
you want can either be done manually or by unit and functional tests. </p>
<div class="well see-also">While you're learning about development environments be sure to check out information on <a href="/vim.html">Vim</a> and <a href="/emacs.html">Emacs</a>.</div>

<h2>A development environment example</h2>
<p>Here's what I (the author of Full Stack Python, 
<a href="/about-author.html">Matt Makai</a>) use to develop most of my Python 
applications. I have a Macbook Pro with Mac OS X as its base operating 
system. <a href="/operating-systems.html">Ubuntu 14.04 LTS</a> is virtualized on top 
with <a href="https://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a>. My code is written in 
<a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> and executed with the 
<a href="https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/">Python 2.7.x</a> interpreter
via the command line. I use <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">virtualenv</a> to create separate Python interpreters
with their own isolated
<a href="/application-dependencies.html">application dependencies</a> and
<a href="http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">virtualenvwrapper</a>
to quickly switch between the interpreters created by virtualenv.</p>
<p>That's a common set up but you can certainly write great code with a much
less expensive set up or a cloud-based development environment.</p>
<h2>Open source text editors</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> is my editor of choice and installed by default
  on most *nix systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a> is another editor often used
  on *nix.</p>

<h2>Hosted development environment services</h2>
<p>In the past couple of years several cloud-based development environments
have popped up. These can work great for when you're learning or stuck on
a machine with only a browser but no way to install your own software. Most
of these have free tiers for getting started and paid tiers as you scale
up your application.</p>

  core developers also has an interview on the 
  <a href="http://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/36/python-ides-with-the-pycharm-teama">Talk Python to Me podcast</a>

<li>
<p><a href="https://opensourcehacker.com/2015/05/02/pycharm-vs-sublime-text/">PyCharm vs Sublime Text</a>
  has a comparison of several features between the two editors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
          <h1>Vim</h1>
<p>Vim, short for Vi IMproved, is a configurable text editor often used as
a Python development environment. Vim proponents commonly cite the numerous
plugins, Vimscript and logical command language as major Vim strengths.</p>
<h2>Why is Vim a good Python development environment?</h2>
<p>Vim's philosophy is that developers are more productive when they avoid
taking their hands off the keyboard. Code should flow naturally from the
developer's thoughts through the keyboard and onto the screen. Using a mouse
or other peripheral is a detriment to the rate at which a developer's
thoughts become code.</p>
<p>Vim has a logical, structured command language. When a beginner is learning
the editor she may feel like it is impossible to understand all the key
commands. However, the commands stack together in a logical way so that over
time the editor becomes predictable.</p>
<div class="well see-also">If you're interested in Vim you'll also want to read about <a href="/development-environments.html">development environments for coding</a> and learn <a href="/why-use-python.html">what makes Python a great programming language</a>.</div>

<h2>Configuring Vim with a Vimrc file</h2>
<p>The Vimrc file is used to configure the Vim editor. A Vimrc file can range
from nothing in it to very complicated with hundreds or thousands of lines
of configuration commands.</p>
<p>Here's a short, commented example .vimrc file I use for Python development
to get a feel for some of the configuration statements:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>&quot; enable syntax highlighting
syntax enable

&quot; show line numbers
set number

&quot; set tabs to have 4 spaces
set ts=4

&quot; indent when moving to the next line while writing code
set autoindent

&quot; expand tabs into spaces
set expandtab

&quot; when using the &gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt; commands, shift lines by 4 spaces
set shiftwidth=4

&quot; show a visual line under the cursor&#39;s current line
set cursorline

&quot; show the matching part of the pair for [] {} and ()
set showmatch

&quot; enable all Python syntax highlighting features
let python_highlight_all = 1
</pre></div>


<p>Here is how these configuration options look with a dark background on
Mac OS X while editing the markdown for this webpage (how meta!).</p>
<p><img src="/img/vim-dark-bg.jpg" width="100%" alt="Vim with basic configuration options on a dark background." class="technical-diagram" style="border-radius: 5px;"></p>
<p>Take a look at another example using these configuration options, this time
with a light background and editing Python code from my
<a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/choose-your-own-adventure-presentations">Choose Your Own Adventures Presentations</a>
project.</p>
<p><img src="/img/vim-white-bg.png" width="100%" alt="Vim with basic configuration options on a white background." class="technical-diagram" style="border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #999;"></p>
<p>The Vimrc file lives under the home directory of the user account running
Vim. For example, when my user account is 'matt', on Mac OS X my Vimrc
file is found at <code>/Users/matt/.vimrc</code>. On Ubuntu Linux my .vimrc file
can be found within the <code>/home/matt/</code> directory.</p>
<p>If a Vimrc file does not already exist, just create it within the user's
home directory and it will be picked up by Vim the next time you open the
editor.</p>
<h2>Vim tutorials</h2>
<p>Vim has a reputation for a difficult learning curve, but it's much easier
to get started with these tutorials.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/">Learn Vim Progressively</a>
  is a wonderful tutorial that follows the path I took when learning Vim:
  learn just enough to survive with it as your day-to-day editor then begin
  adding more advanced commands on top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/">A vim Tutorial and Primer</a> is an
  incredibly deep study in how to go from beginner to knowledgeable in Vim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@mkozlows/why-atom-cant-replace-vim-433852f4b4d1">Why Atom Can't Replace Vim</a>
  discusses one of Vim's core principles: command composability. Vim has 
  a language where simple commands are combined to execute more advanced 
  operations. For example, in command mode,<code>$</code> moves to the end of a line.
  When <code>$</code> is preceded by <code>d</code> then everything to the end of the line is
  deleted. Over time the simple commands become intuitive and the 
  combinations become more powerful than having distinct commands such as
  a drop-down menu with a specific option to delete all text until the end
  of the line.</p>

<h2>Vimrc resources</h2>
<p>These are a few resources for learning how to structure a <code>.vimrc</code> file. I
recommend adding configuration options one at a time to test them
individually instead of going whole hog with a Vimrc you are unfamiliar with.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://dougblack.io/words/a-good-vimrc.html">A Good Vimrc</a> is a fantastic,

          <h1>Emacs</h1>
<p>Emacs is an extensible text editor that can be customized by writing Lisp
code.</p>
<h2>Why is Emacs a good choice for Python coding?</h2>
<p>Emacs is designed to be customized via the built-in Lisp interpreter and
package manager. The package manager, named package.el, has menus for
handling installation. The largest Lisp Package Archive is 
<a href="http://melpa.org">Melpa</a>, which provides automatic updates from upstream
sources.</p>
<p>Macros are useful for performing repetitive actions in Emacs. A macro
is just a recording of a previous set of keystrokes that can be replayed
to perform future actions.</p>
<p>Hooks, which are Lisp variables that hold lists of functions to call,
provide an extension mechanism for Emacs. For example,
<code>kill-emacs-hook</code> runs before exiting Emacs so functions can be loaded
into that hook to perform necessary actions before the exiting completes.</p>

<p>Generators are a Python core language construct that allow a function's return
value to behave as an iterator. A generator can allow more efficient 
memory usage by allocating and deallocating memory during the context of a 
large number of iterations. Generators are defined in 
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/">PEP255</a> and included in the
language as of Python 2.2 in 2001.</p>

          <h1>Comprehensions</h1>
<p>Comprehensions are a Python language construct for concisely creating data
in lists, dictionaries and sets. List comprehensions are included in Python 2
while dictionary and set comprehensions were introduced to the language in
Python 3.</p>
<h2>Why are comprehensions important?</h2>
<p>Comprehensions are a more clear syntax for populating conditional data in the 
core Python data structures. Creating data without comprehensions often 
involves nested loops with conditionals that can be difficult for code
readers to properly evaluate.</p>
<h2>Example code</h2>
<p>List comprehension:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; double_digit_evens = [e*2 for e in range(5, 50)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; double_digit_evens
[10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98]
</pre></div>


<p>Set comprehension:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; double_digit_odds = {e*2+1 for e in range(5, 50)}
{11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99}

          <h1>Web Development</h1>
<p>Web development is the umbrella term for conceptualizing, creating, 
<a href="/deployment.html">deploying</a> and operating web applications and 
<a href="/application-programming-interfaces.html">application programming interfaces</a>
for the Web.</p>
<h2>Why is web development important?</h2>
<p>The Web has grown a mindboggling amount in the number of sites, users and
implementation capabilities since the 
<a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">first website</a> went live
in <a href="http://home.cern/topics/birth-web">1989</a>. Web development is the concept
that encompasses all the activities involved with websites and web 
applications.</p>
<h2>How does Python fit into web development?</h2>
<p>Python can be used to build server-side web applications. While a
<a href="/web-frameworks.html">web framework</a> is not required to build web apps,
it's rare that developers would not use existing open source libraries to
speed up their progress in getting their application working.</p>
<p>Python is not used in a web browser. The language executed in browsers
such as Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer is 
<a href="/javascript.html">JavaScript</a>. Projects such as <a href="http://pyjs.org/">pyjs</a> 
can compile from Python to JavaScript. However, most Python developers are 
write their web applications in a combination of Python, which is executed
on the server side and JavaScript, which is downloaded to the web browser
client and executed there.</p>
<h3>Web development resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/01/web-application-development-is-different-and-better.html">Web application development is different and better</a>
  provides some context for how web development has evolved from writing
  static HTML files into the complex JavaScript client-side applications
  produced today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While not Python-specific, Mozilla put together a 
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn">Learning the Web</a> tutorial
  for beginners and intermediate web users who want to build websites.
  It's worth a look for general web development learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://www.evolutionoftheweb.com/">Evolution of the Web</a> visualizes 
  how web browsers and related technologies have changed over time as well as
  the overall growth of the Internet in the amount of data transferred. Note 
  that the visualization unfortunately stops around the beginning of 2013 but
  it's a good way to explore what happened in the first 24 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web development involves HTTP communication between the server, hosting
  a website or web application, and the client, a web browser. Knowing
  how web browsers works is important as a developer, so take a look at
  this article on 
  <a href="https://medium.com/@camaelon/what-s-in-a-web-browser-83793b51df6c">what's in a web browser</a>.</p>

  is a must-read for every web developer. Not everyone has fast Internet
  service, whether because they are in a remote part of the world or they're
  just in a subway tunnel. Optimizing sites so they work in those situations
  is important for keeping your users happy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
          <h1>Web frameworks</h1>
<p>A web framework is a code library that makes a developer's life easier when 
building reliable, scalable and maintainable web applications.</p>
<h2>Why are web frameworks necessary?</h2>
<p>Web frameworks encapsulate what developers have learned over the past twenty
years while programming sites and applications for the web. Frameworks make 
it easier to reuse code for common HTTP operations and to structure projects 
so other developers with knowledge of the framework can quickly build and
maintain the application.</p>
<h2>Common web framework functionality</h2>
<p>Frameworks provide functionality in their code or through extensions to 
perform common operations required to run web applications. These common 
operations include:</p>
<ol>
<li>URL routing</li>
<li>HTML, XML, JSON, and other output format templating</li>
<li>Database manipulation</li>
<li>Security against Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and other attacks</li>
<li>Session storage and retrieval</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all web frameworks include code for all of the above functionality. 
Frameworks fall on the spectrum from executing a single use case to providing 
every known web framework feature to every developer. Some frameworks take 
the "batteries-included" approach where everything possible comes bundled 
with the framework while others have a minimal core package that is amenable
to extensions provided by other packages.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="/django.html">Django web application framework</a> includes an 
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer that abstracts relational database 
read, write, query, and delete operations. However, Django's ORM
cannot work without significant modification on non-relational databases 
such as <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>.</p>
<p>Some other web frameworks such as <a href="/flask.html">Flask</a> and 
<a href="/pyramid.html">Pyramid</a> are easier to
use with non-relational databases by incorporating external Python libraries.
There is a spectrum between minimal functionality with easy extensibility on
one end and including everything in the framework with tight integration on
the other end.</p>
<h2>Comparing web frameworks</h2>
<p>Are you curious about how the code in a Django project is structured compared 
with Flask? Check out 
<a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/howto/walkthrough/appointment-reminders/python/django">this Django web application tutorial</a> 
and then view <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/howto/walkthrough/appointment-reminders/python/flask">the same application built with Flask</a>.</p>
<p>There is also a repository called
<a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/compare-python-web-frameworks">compare-python-web-frameworks</a>
where the same web application is being coded with varying Python web 
frameworks, templating engines and 
<a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">object-relational mappers</a>.</p>
<div class="well see-also">While you're learning about web frameworks you should also study <a href="/deployment.html">web application deployment</a> and <a href="/application-programming-interfaces.html">web APIs</a>.</div>

<h2>Do I have to use a web framework?</h2>
<p>Whether or not you use a web framework in your project depends on your 
experience with web development and what you're trying to accomplish. If you 
are a beginner programmer and just want to work on a web application as a 
learning project then a framework can help you understand the concepts listed
above, such as URL routing, data manipulation and authentication that are
common to the majority of web applications.</p>
<p>On the other hand if you're an experienced programmer with significant 
web development experience you may feel like the existing frameworks do not
match your project's requirements. In that case, you can mix and match
open source libraries such as <a href="http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/">Werkzeug</a> for
WSGI plumbing with your own code to create your own framework. There's 
still plenty of room in the Python ecosystem for new frameworks to satisfy 
the needs of web developers that are unmet by <a href="/django.html">Django</a>, 
<a href="/flask.html">Flask</a>, <a href="/pyramid.html">Pyramid</a>, <a href="/bottle.html">Bottle</a> and 
<a href="/other-web-frameworks.html">many others</a>.</p>
<p>In short, whether or not you need to use a web framework to build a web 
application depends on your experience and what you're trying to accomplish. 
Using a web framework to build a web application certainly isn't required, 
but it'll make most developers' lives easier in many cases.</p>
<h2>Web framework resources</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you are learning how to use one or more web frameworks it's helpful
  to have an idea of what the code under the covers is doing. This post on
  building a 
  <a href="http://mattscodecave.com/posts/simple-python-framework-from-scratch.html">simple Python framework from scratch</a>
  shows how HTTP connections, routing, and requests can work in just 
  320 lines of code. This post is awesome even though the resulting framework
  is a simplification of what frameworks such as <a href="/django.html">Django</a>, 
  <a href="/flask.html">Flask</a> and <a href="/pyramid.html">Pyramid</a> allow developers to 
  accomplish.</p>

<h2>Web frameworks learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Choose a major Python web framework (<a href="/django.html">Django</a> or 
   <a href="/flask.html">Flask</a> are recommended) and stick with it. When you're just
   starting it's best to learn one framework first instead of bouncing around
   trying to understand every framework. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work through a detailed tutorial found within the resources links on the
   framework's page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study open source examples built with your framework of choice so you can 
   take parts of those projects and reuse the code in your application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build the first simple iteration of your web application then go to
   the <a href="/deployment.html">deployment</a> section to make it accessible on the 
   web.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Django</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> is a widely-used Python web 
application framework with a "batteries-included" philosophy. The principle
behind batteries-included is that the common functionality for building
web applications should come with the framework instead of as separate
libraries.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" style="border: none;"><img src="/img/django-logo-positive.png" width="100%" alt="Official Django logo. Trademark Django Software Foundation." class="technical-diagram" /></a></p>
<p>For example, 
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/">authentication</a>,
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/urls/">URL routing</a>, a 
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/">templating system</a>,
an <a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">object-relational mapper</a> (ORM),
and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/migrations/">database schema migrations</a>
(as of version 1.7) are all included with the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django/">Django framework</a>. 
Compare that included functionality to the Flask framework which requires a 
separate library such as 
<a href="https://flask-login.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Flask-Login</a>
to perform user authentication. </p>
<p>The batteries-included and extensibility philosophies are simply two different
ways to tackle framework building. Neither philosophy is inherently better 
than the other one.</p>
<div class="well see-also">Django is an implementation of the <a href="/web-frameworks.html">web frameworks</a> concept. Learn how these pieces fit together in the <a href="/web-development.html">web development</a> chapter or view the <a href="/table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> for all topics.</div>

<h2>Why is Django a good web framework choice?</h2>
<p>The Django project's stability, performance and community have grown 
tremendously over the past decade since the framework's creation. Detailed
tutorials and good practices are readily available on the web and in books.
The framework continues to add significant new functionality such as 
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/migrations/">database migrations</a>
with each release. </p>
<p>I highly recommend the Django framework as a starting place for new Python web 
developers because the official documentation and tutorials are some of the 
best anywhere in software development. Many cities also have Django-specific
groups such as <a href="http://www.meetup.com/django-district/">Django District</a>,
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/">Django Boston</a> and 
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-San-Francisco-Django-Meetup-Group/">San Francisco Django</a> 
so new developers can get help when they are stuck.</p>
<p>There's some debate on whether 
<a href="http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/12/11/learning-python-via-django-considered-harmful/">learning Python by using Django is a bad idea</a>. 
However, that criticism is invalid if you take the time to learn the Python
syntax and language semantics first before diving into web development.</p>
<h2>Django books and tutorials</h2>

<h2>Django learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/">Install Django</a> on
   your local development machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work through the initial 
   <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/">"polls" tutorial</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build a few more simple applications using the tutorial resources found
   in the "Django resources" section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start coding your own Django project with help from the 
   <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/">official documentation</a> and 
   resource links below. You'll make plenty of mistakes which is critical
   on your path to learning the right way to build applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-Best-Practices/dp/0981467342">2 Scoops of Django</a> 
   to understand Django good practices and learn better ways of building 
   Django web applications.</p>

   project on the web.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Flask</h1>
<p><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> is a Python web framework built with a 
<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/design/">small core and easy-to-extend philosophy</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" style="border: none;"><img src="/img/flask.jpg" width="100%" alt="Official Flask logo. Flask Artwork License." class="technical-diagram"></a></p>
<h2>Why is Flask a good web framework choice?</h2>
<p>Flask is considered more 
<a href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/older/what-is-pythonic.html">Pythonic</a>
than Django because Flask web application code is in most cases more explicit. 
Flask is easy to get started with as a beginner because there is little 
boilerplate code for getting a simple app up and running. </p>
<p>For example, here's a valid "hello world" web application with Flask (the
equivalent in Django would be significantly more code):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">flask</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Flask</span>
<span class="n">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Flask</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">__name__</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nd">@app.route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;/&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello_world</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">&#39;Hello World!&#39;</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&#39;__main__&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Flask was also written several years after Django and therefore
learned from the Python community's reactions as the framework evolved.
Jökull Sólberg wrote a great piece articulating to this effect in his 
<a href="http://jokull.calepin.co/my-flask-to-django-experience.html">experience switching between Flask and Django</a>.</p>
<div class="well see-also">Flask is an implementation of the <a href="/web-frameworks.html">web frameworks</a> concept. Learn how these pieces fit together in the <a href="/web-development.html">web development</a> chapter or view the <a href="/table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> for all topics.</div>

<h2>Should I use Bottle for web development?</h2>
<p>Bottle is awesome for a few web development situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prototyping ideas </li>
<li>Learning how web frameworks are built</li>
<li>Building and running simple personal web applications </li>
</ol>
<h4>Prototyping</h4>
<p>Prototyping simple ideas is often easier with Bottle than a more
opinionated web framework like <a href="/django.html">Django</a> because Django
projects start with a significant amount of boilerplate code. The
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/faq/general/#django-appears-to-be-a-mvc-framework-but-you-call-the-controller-the-view-and-the-view-the-template-how-come-you-don-t-use-the-standard-names">Model-View-Template</a>
structure for Django apps within projects makes maintaining projects
easier, but it can be cumbersome on starter projects where you're
just playing with random ideas so you aren't worried about your 
application's long-term code structure.</p>
<h4>Learning about frameworks</h4>
<p>Bottle is contained 
<a href="https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle/blob/master/bottle.py">within a single large source file</a> 
named <code>bottle.py</code> so it provides great reading when learning how 
<a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI</a> web frameworks work. Everything you need to learn 
about how your web application's code connects with the Bottle framework is 
contained within that single source code.</p>
<h4>Personal projects</h4>
<p>Personal projects can be deployed with Bottle as the only dependency.
If you've never performed a <a href="/deployment.html">Python web app deployment</a>
before, the number of concepts and steps can be daunting. By packaging
<code>bottle.py</code> with your app's source code, you can skip some of the
steps to more easily get your web application up and running. </p>

          <h1>Morepath</h1>
<p><a href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Morepath</a> is a micro web 
framework with a model-driven approach to creating web applications and web
APIs.</p>
<p>Morepath's framework philosophy is that the data models should drive the
creation via the web framework. By default the framework routes URLs directly 
to model code, unlike for example Django which requires explicit URL routing
by the developer.</p>
<h2>Why is Morepath an interesting web framework?</h2>
<p>Simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD web applications and APIs</a> 
can be tedious to build when they are driven straight from data models without
much logic between the model and the view. Learn more about how Morepath
<a href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/compared.html">compares with other web frameworks</a>
from the creator.</p>
<p>With the rise of front end JavaScript frameworks, many Python web frameworks 
are first being used to build 
<a href="/application-programming-interfaces.html">RESTful APIs</a> that return JSON
instead rendering HTML via a templating system. Morepath appears to have 
been created with the RESTful API model approach in mind and cuts out the 
assumption that templates will drive the user interface.</p>

<h2>Other frameworks learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Read through the web frameworks listed above and check out their project
   websites. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's useful to know what other web frameworks exist besides Django and 
   Flask. However, when you're just starting to learn to program there are 
   significantly more tutorials and resources for <a href="/django.html">Django</a> and 
   <a href="/flask.html">Flask</a> on the web. My recommendation is to start with one of
   those two frameworks then expand your knowledge from there.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Web Design</h1>
<p>Web design is the creation of a web application's style and user interaction
using CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<h2>Why is web design important?</h2>
<p>You wouldn’t use a web application that looked like the following screenshot, 
would you?</p>
<p><img src="/img/no-style-webpage.png" width="100%" alt="HTML with no CSS or JavaScript." class="technical-diagram" /> </p>
<p>Creating web pages with their own style and interactivity so users can easily
accomplish their tasks is a major part of building modern web applications.</p>
<h2>Responsive design</h2>
<p>Separating the content from the rules for how to display the content allows 
devices to render the output differently based on factors such as screen size
and device type. Displaying content differently based on varying screen 
attributes is often called <em>responsive design</em>. The responsiveness is 
accomplished by implementing
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries">media queries</a>
in the <a href="/cascading-style-sheets.html">CSS</a>. </p>
<p>For example, a mobile device does not have as much space to display a 
navigation bar on the side of a page so it is often pushed down 
below the main content. The 
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/examples/blog/">Bootstrap Blog example</a> 
shows that navigation bar relocation scenario when you resize the browser 
width.</p>
<h2>Design resources</h2>

<p>If you want to learn more about how browsers work behind the scenes, 
  here's a 
  <a href="http://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html">blog post series on building a browser engine</a>
  that will show you how to build a simple rendering engine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
          <h1>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h1>
<p>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) files contain rules for how to display and 
lay out the HTML content when it is rendered by a web browser.</p>
<h2>Why is CSS necessary?</h2>
<p>CSS separates the content contained in HTML files from how the content 
should be displayed. It is important to separate the content from the rules
for how it should be rendered primarily because it is easier to reuse those
rules across many pages. CSS files are also much easier to maintain on large
projects than styles embedded within the HTML files.</p>
<h2>How is CSS retrieved from a web server?</h2>
<p>The HTML file sent by the web server contains a reference to the CSS file(s)
needed to render the content. The web browser requests the CSS file after the
HTML file as shown below in a screenshot captured of the Chrome Web Developer 
Tools network traffic.</p>
<p><img src="/img/css-chrome-dev-tools.jpg" width="100%" alt="Google Chrome Web Developer Tools shows how CSS is separate from the HTML content." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>That request for the fsp.css file is made because the HTML file for Full 
Stack Python contains a reference to <code>theme/css/fsp.css</code> which is shown
in the view source screenshot below.</p>
<p><img src="/img/fsp-css-source.jpg" width="100%" alt="View source screenshot for the fsp.css file in index.html." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<h2>CSS preprocessors</h2>
<p>A CSS preprocessor compiles a processed language into plain CSS code. CSS 
preprocessing languages add syntax such as variables, mixins and functions
to reduce code duplication. The additional syntax also makes it possible for
designers to use these basic programming constructs to write maintainable
front end code.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> is currently the favored preprocessor in
  the design community. Sass is considered the most powerful CSS preprocessor
  in terms of advanced language features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> is right up there with Sass and has an ace up
  its sleeve in that the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap Framework</a> is
  written in LESS which brings up its popularity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/">Stylus</a> is often cited as the third
  most popular CSS preprocessing language.</p>

<h2>CSS learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a simple HTML file with basic elements in it. Use the
   <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code> command to serve it up. Create a 
   <code>&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</code> element within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section in the HTML
   markup. Play with CSS within that style element to change the look and 
   feel of the page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check out front end frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation and integrate
   one of those into the HTML page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work through the framework's grid system, styling options and customization
   so you get comfortable with how to use the framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply the framework to your web application and tweak the design until you
   have something that looks much better than generic HTML.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>JavaScript</h1>
<p>JavaScript is a small scripting programming language embedded in web browsers 
to enable dynamic content and interaction. </p>
<h2>Why is JavaScript necessary?</h2>
<p>JavaScript executes in the client and enables dynamic content and interaction
that is not possible with HTML and CSS alone. Every modern Python web 
application uses JavaScript on the front end. </p>
<h2>Front end frameworks</h2>
<p>Front end JavaScript frameworks move the rendering for most of a web 
application to the client side. Often these applications are informally 
referred to as "one page apps" because the webpage is not reloaded upon every
click to a new URL. Instead, partial HTML pages are loaded into the 
document object model or data is retrieved through an API call then displayed

<h2>JavaScript learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a simple HTML file with basic elements in it. Use the
   <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code> command to serve it up. Create a 
   <code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> 
   element at the end of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section in the HTML page. Play
   with JavaScript within that element to learn the basic syntax.</p>

          <h1>WebSockets</h1>
<p>A WebSocket is a <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">standard protocol</a> for 
two-way data transfer between a client and server. The WebSockets protocol 
does not run over HTTP, instead it is a separate implementation on top of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a>.</p>
<h2>Why use WebSockets?</h2>
<p>A WebSocket connection allows full-duplex communication between a client 
and server so that either side can push data to the other through an 
established connection. The reason why WebSockets, along with the related 
technologies of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events">Server-sent Events</a> (SSE) 
and 
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rtcweb-data-channel-12">WebRTC data channels</a>, 
are important is that HTTP is not meant for keeping open a connection for
the server to frequently push data to a web browser. Previously, most web
applications would implement long polling via frequent
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) requests as shown in the below diagram. </p>
<p><img src="/img/ajax-long-polling.png" width="100%" alt="Long polling via AJAX is incredibly inefficient for some applications." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>Server push is more efficient and scalable than long polling because the 
web browser does not have to constantly ask for updates through a stream 
of AJAX requests.</p>
<p><img src="/img/websockets-flow.png" width="100%" alt="WebSockets are more efficient than long polling for server sent updates." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>While the above diagram shows a server pushing data to the client, WebSockets
is a full-duplex connection so the client can also push data to the server
as shown in the diagram below.</p>
<p><img src="/img/websockets-flow-with-client-push.png" width="100%" alt="WebSockets also allow client push in addition to server pushed updates." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>The WebSockets approach for server- and client-pushed updates works well for 
certain categories of web applications such as chat room, which is why that's 
often an example application for a WebSocket library.</p>
<h2>Implementing WebSockets</h2>
<p>Both the web browser and the server must implement the WebSockets protocol
to establish and maintain the connection. There are important implications for 
servers since WebSockets connections are long lived, unlike typical HTTP 
connections. </p>
<p>A multi-threaded or multi-process based server cannot scale appropriately for
WebSockets because it is designed to open a connection, handle a request as 
quickly as possible and then close the connection. An asynchronous server such 
as <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/">Tornado</a> or 
<a href="http://gunicorn.org/">Green Unicorn</a> monkey patched with 
<a href="http://www.gevent.org/">gevent</a> is necessary for any practical WebSockets 
server-side implementation.</p>
<p>On the client side, it is not necessary to use a JavaScript library for 
WebSockets. Web browsers that implement WebSockets will expose all necessary
client-side functionality through the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-websockets-20110419/">WebSockets object</a>. </p>
<p>However, a JavaScript wrapper library can make a developer's life easier by 
implementing graceful degradation (often falling back to long-polling when 
WebSockets are not supported) and by providing a wrapper around 
browser-specific WebSocket quirks. Examples of JavaScript client libraries 
and Python implementations are found below.</p>
<h2>JavaScript client libraries</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.io</a>'s client side JavaScript library can be 
  used to connect to a server side WebSockets implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js">web-socket-js</a> is a Flash-based
  client-side WebSockets implementation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Python implementations</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://autobahn.ws/python/">Autobahn</a> uses Twisted or asyncio to implement
  the WebSockets protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://crossbar.io/">Crossbar.io</a> builds upon Autobahn and includes a
  separate server for handling the WebSockets connections if desired by
  the web app developer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nginx WebSocket proxying</h2>
<p>Nginx officially supports WebSocket proxying as of 
<a href="http://nginx.com/blog/websocket-nginx/">version 1.3</a>. However, you have
to configure the Upgrade and Connection headers to ensure requests are
passed through Nginx to your WSGI server. It can be tricky to set this up
the first time. </p>
<p>Here are the configuration settings I use in my Nginx file as part of my
WebSockets proxy.</p>

          <h1>Template Engines</h1>
<p>Template engines process template files, which provide an intermediate format 
between your Python code and a desired output format, such as HTML or PDF.</p>
<h2>Why are template engines important?</h2>
<p>Template engines allow developers to generate a desired content type, such 
as HTML, while using some of the data and programming constructs such as 
conditionals and for loops to manipulate the output. Template files that are 
created by developers and then processed by the template engine consist of
prewritten markup and template tag blocks where data is inserted.</p>
<p>For example, look at the first ten source lines of HTML of this webpage:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;html</span> <span class="na">lang=</span><span class="s">&quot;en&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">http-equiv=</span><span class="s">&quot;Content-Type&quot;</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">charset=</span><span class="s">&quot;utf-8&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">http-equiv=</span><span class="s">&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot;</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">&quot;IE=edge&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;viewport&quot;</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;author&quot;</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">&quot;Matt Makai&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;description&quot;</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">&quot;Template engines provide programmatic output of formatted content such as HTML, XML or PDF.&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;shortcut icon&quot;</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;//static.fullstackpython.com/fsp-fav.png&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Every one of the HTML lines above is standard for each page on Full Stack Python,
with the exception of the <code>&lt;meta name="description"...</code> line which provides
a unique short description of what the individual page contains.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com/blob/gh-pages/source/theme/templates/base.html">base.html Jinja template</a> used to generate Full Stack Python
allows every page on the site to have consistent HTML but 
dynamically generate the pieces that need to change between pages when 
the <a href="/static-site-generator.html">static site generator</a> executes. The below
code from the <code>base.html</code> template shows that the meta description is up to child 
templates to create.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;html</span> <span class="na">lang=</span><span class="s">&quot;en&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

<p>In a typical <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI application</a>, the template engine would 
generate the HTML output response when an HTTP request comes in for a 
particular URL. </p>
<h2>Python template engines</h2>
<p>There are several popular Python template engines. A template engine implementation 
will fall somewhere on the spectrum between allowing arbitrary code execution and 
granting only a limited set of capabilities via template tags. A rough visual of
the code in template spectrum can be seen below for four of the major Python
template engines.</p>
<p><img src="/img/template-logic-spectrum.png" width="100%" alt="Spectrum between no logic in templates and the ability to run arbitrary code." class="technical-diagram" style="border-radius: 5px;"></p>
<h3>Jinja</h3>
<p><a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja</a>, also known as "Jinja2", is a popular Python 
template engine written as an independent open source project, unlike some
template engines that are provided as part of a larger web framework.</p>
<p>Major Python open source applications such as the 
<a href="/configuration-management.html">configuration management</a> tools Ansible
and <a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt">SaltStack</a>
as well as the <a href="/static-site-generator.html">static site generator</a> Pelican use
the Jinja template engine by default for generating output files.</p>
<p>There's a whole lot more to learn about Jinja on the <a href="/jinja2.html">Jinja2</a> page.</p>
<h3>Django templating</h3>
<p>Django comes with its 
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/">own template engine</a>
in addition to supporting (as of Django 1.9) drop-in replacement with other
template engines such as Jinja.</p>
<h3>Mako</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.makotemplates.org/">Mako</a> is the default templating engine for
the <a href="/pyramid.html">Pyramid web framework</a> and has wide support as a replacement
template engine for many <a href="/other-web-frameworks.html">other web frameworks</a>.</p>

          <h1>Web Application Security</h1>
<p>Website security must be thought about while building every level of the web 
stack. However, this section includes topics that deserve particular
treatment, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, cross-site 
request forgery and usage of public-private keypairs.</p>

<h2>Web security learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Read and understand the major web application security flaws that are
   commonly exploited by malicious actors. These include cross-site request 
   forgery (CSRF), cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection and session 
   hijacking. The 
   <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10">OWASP top 10 web application vulnerabilities list</a> 
   is a great place to get an overview of these topics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine how the framework you've chosen mitigates these vulnerabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure your code implements the mitigation techniques for your framework. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think like an attacker and actively work to break into your own system. 
   If you do not have enough experience to confidently break the security 
   consider hiring a known white hat attacker. Have her break the 
   application's security, report the easiest vulnerabilities to exploit in 
   your app and help implement protections against those weaknesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognize that no system is ever totally secure. However, the more popular
   an application becomes the more attractive a target it is to attackers.
   Reevaluate your web application security on a frequent basis.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Static Site Generator</h1>
<p>A static website generator combines a markup language, such as Markdown 
or reStructuredText, with a templating engine such as 
<a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja</a>, to produce HTML 
files. The HTML files can be hosted and served by a 
<a href="/web-servers.html">web server</a> or 
<a href="/static-content.html">content delivery network (CDN)</a> 
<em>without</em> any additional dependencies such as a 
<a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI server</a>.</p>
<h2>Why are static site generators useful?</h2>
<p><a href="/static-content.html">Static content files</a> such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
can be served from a content delivery network (CDN) for high scale and low 
cost. If a statically generated website is hit by high concurrent traffic it 
will be easily served by the CDN without dropped connections. </p>
<p>For example, when 
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7985692">Full Stack Python was on the top of Hacker News</a> 
for a weekend, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> was used as a CDN
to serve the site and didn't have any issues even with close to 400 
concurrent connections at a time, as shown in the following Google Analytics 
screenshot captured during that traffic burst.</p>
<p><img src="/img/hacker-news-traffic.jpg" width="100%" alt="Example of how static websites scale with a CDN based on Full Stack Python on Hacker News front page traffic." class="technical-diagram"></p>
<h2>How do static website generators work?</h2>
<p>Static site generators allow a user to create HTML files by writing in a
markup language and coding template files. The static site generator then
combines the markup language and templates to produce HTML. The output HTML 
does not need to be maintained by hand because it is regenerated every time
the markup or templates are modified.</p>
<p>For example, as shown in the diagram below, the Pelican static site 
generator can take in reStructuredText files and Jinja2 template files 
as input then combine them to output a set of static HTML files.</p>
<p><img src="/img/pelican-flow.jpg" width="100%" alt="Example of how static site generators work with a markup language and templates." class="technical-diagram"></p>
<h2>What's the downside of using static site generators?</h2>
<p>The major downside is that code cannot be executed after a site is created. 
You are stuck with the output files so if you're used to building web 
applications with a traditional <a href="/web-frameworks.html">web framework</a> you'll
have to change your expectations. </p>
<p>Content that is typically powered by a database, such as comments, sessions 
and user data can only be handled through third party services. For example, 
if you want to have comments on a static website you'd need to 
<a href="https://disqus.com/">embed Disqus's form</a> and be completely reliant upon
their service.</p>
<p>Many web applications simply cannot be built with only a static site generator.
However, a static website generator can create part of a site that will be
served up by a web server while other pages are handled by the WSGI server. 
If done right, those web applications have the potential to scale better than
if every page is rendered by the WSGI server. The complexity may or may not be
worth it for your specific application.</p>
<h2>Python implementations</h2>
<p>Numerous static website generators exist in many different languages. The
ones listed here are primarily coded in Python.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> 
  (<a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican">source code</a>) 
  is a commonly used Python static website generator which is used to create 
  <a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com">Full Stack Python</a>. The
  primary templating engine is Jinja and Markdown, reStructuredText and
  AsciiDoc are supported with the default configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.mkdocs.org/">MkDocs</a> 
  (<a href="https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/">source code</a>) uses a YAML configuration
  file to take Markdown files and an optional theme to output a documentation
  site. The templating engine is Jinja, but a user doesn't have to create her
  own templates unless a custom site is desired at which point it might make
  more sense to use a different static site generator instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> 
  (<a href="https://github.com/getnikola/nikola">source code</a>) takes in 
  reStructuredText, Markdown or Jupyter (IPython) Notebooks and combines 
  the files with Mako or Jinja2 templates to output static sites. It is 
  compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3.3+. Python 2.7 will be dropped 
  in early 2016 while Python 3.3+ will continue to be supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://posativ.org/acrylamid/">Acrylamid</a> 
  (<a href="https://github.com/posativ/acrylamid">source code</a>) uses incremental 
  builds to generate static sites faster than recreating every page after
  each change is made to the input files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://hyde.github.io/">Hyde</a> 
  (<a href="https://github.com/hyde/hyde">source code</a>) started out as a Python 
  rewrite of the popular Ruby-based 
  <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll static site generator</a>. Today the project
  has moved past those "clone Jekyll" origins. Hyde supports Jinja as well
  as other templating languages and places more emphasis on metadata within
  the markup files to instruct the generator how to produce the output files.
  Check out the 
  <a href="https://github.com/hyde/hyde/wiki/Hyde-Powered">Hyde-powered websites</a>
  page to see live examples created with Hyde.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://growsdk.org/">Grow SDK</a> (<a href="http://growsdk.org/">source code</a>) 
  uses projects, known as pods, which contain a specific file and directory 
  structure so the site can be generated. The project remains in the
  "experimental" phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.getlektor.com/">Lektor</a> 
  (<a href="https://github.com/lektor/lektor">source code</a>) is a Python static 
  content management system that can deploy to any webserver. It uses 
  <a href="/jinja2.html">Jinja2</a> as a <a href="/template-engines.html">template engine</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://complexity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Complexity</a>
  (<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/complexity">source code</a>) is a site generator
  for users who like to work in HTML. It uses HTML for templating but
  has some functionality from Jinja for inheritance. Works with 
  Python 2.6+, 3.3+ and PyPy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cactus (<a href="https://github.com/koenbok/Cactus/">source code</a>) uses the Django
  templating engine that was originally built with front-end designers in
  mind. It works with both Python 2.x and 3.x.</p>

          <h1>Jinja2</h1>
<p><a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/">Jinja2</a> is a Python 
<a href="/template-engines.html">template engine</a> used to create HTML, XML or 
other markup formats that are returned to the user via an HTTP response.</p>
<h2>Why is Jinja2 useful?</h2>
<p>Jinja2 is useful because it has consistent template tag syntax and the
project is cleanly extracted as 
<a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2">an independent open source project</a> so
it can be used as a dependency by other code libraries.</p>
<div class="well see-also">Jinja2 is an implementation of the <a href="/template-engines.html">template engines</a> concept. Learn more in the <a href="/web-development.html">web development</a> chapter or view the <a href="/table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> for all topics.</div>

<p>Jinja2 strikes a thoughtful balance on the template engine spectrum where
on one end you can embed arbitrary code in the templates and the other
end a developer can code whatever she wants.</p>
<h2>Jinja2 origin and development</h2>
<p>The first recorded public released of Jinja2 was in 
<a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/changelog/#version-2-0rc1">2008 with 2.0rc1</a>.
Since then the engine has seen numerous updates and remains in active
development.</p>
<p>Jinja2 engine certainly wasn't the first template engine. In fact, Jinja2's 
syntax is inspired by Django's built-in template engine, which was released 
several years earlier. There were many template systems, such as 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages">JavaServer Pages (JSPs)</a>,
that originated almost a decade before Jinja2. Jinja2 built upon the concepts
of other template engines and today is widely used by the Python community.</p>
<h2>What projects depend on Jinja2?</h2>
<p>Jinja2 is a commonly-used templating engine for
<a href="/web-frameworks.html">web frameworks</a> such as <a href="/flask.html">Flask</a>, 
<a href="/bottle.html">Bottle</a>, <a href="/morepath.html">Morepath</a> and, as of its 1.8 update,
optionally <a href="/django.html">Django</a> as well. Jinja2 is also used as a template
language by <a href="/configuration-management.html">configuration management</a> tool 
Ansible and the <a href="/static-site-generator.html">static site generator</a> Pelican,
among many other similar tools.</p>
<p>The idea is that if a developer already knows Jinja2 from working with one 
project then the exact same syntax and style can be used in another project 
that requires templating. The re-use reduces the learning curve and saves the
open source project author from having to reinvent a new templating style.</p>
<h3>Jinja2 resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Real Python has a nice 
  <a href="https://realpython.com/blog/python/primer-on-jinja-templating/">Jinja2 primer</a>

</li>
<li>

          <h1>Data</h1>
<p>Data is an incredibly broad topic but it can be broken down into many
subsections, including (in no particular order):</p>
<ul>
<li>data processing / wrangling</li>
<li>machine learning</li>
<li>data analysis</li>
<li>visualization</li>
<li>geospatial mapping</li>
<li>persistence via <a href="/databases.html">relational databases</a> and 
  <a href="/no-sql-datastore.html">NoSQL data stores</a></li>
<li><a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">object-relational mappers</a></li>
<li>natural language processing (NLP)</li>
<li>indexing, search and retrieval</li>
</ul>
<p>The Python community has built and continues to create open source libraries 
and tutorials for all of the above topics.</p>
<h2>Why is Python a great language choice for data tasks?</h2>
<p>Python has a wide array of open source code libraries available and a
diverse community of people with different backgrounds who contribute to
make those libraries better each day.</p>
<p>In addition, Python data manipulation code can be combined with 
<a href="/web-frameworks.html">web frameworks</a> and
<a href="/application-programming-interfaces.html">web APIs</a> to build software
that would be difficult to create with a single other language. For example,
Ruby is a fantastic language for building web applications but its data
analysis and visualization libraries are very limited compared to what
is currently available in the Python ecosystem.</p>
<h2>How did Python become so widely used for working with data?</h2>
<p>Python is a general purpose programming language and can be applied to
many problem areas. Over the past couple of decades, Python has become 
increasingly popular in the scientific and financial communities. Projects
such as <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> grew out of a hedge-fund while
<a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a> and <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> were
created in academic environments then improved by the broader open source
community.</p>
<p>The question is: why Python was used to created these projects? The answer
is a mix of luck, the growth of the open source community as Python was
maturing and wide adoption by people not formally trained as computer 
scientists. The pragmatic syntax and explicit style helped very intelligent
people without programming backgrounds to pick up the language and get their
work done with less fuss than other programming languages. Over time the
code used in the financial world and scientific community was shared at the
same time global open source communities were developing, further spreading
their usage among a broader base of software developers.</p>
<p>There's no doubt some of the momentum behind Python's wide adoption for all 
types of data manipulation was that it happened to be the right language in
the right place at the right time. Nevertheless, it was ultimately the hard 
work of a massive number of engineers and scientists around the world who
created the incredible mix of data code libraries available today.</p>
<h3>General Python data resources</h3>

</li>
</ul>
          <h1>Databases</h1>
<p>A database is an abstraction on top of an operating system's file system to 
ease creating, reading, updating, and deleting persistent data. </p>
<h2>Why are databases necessary?</h2>
<p>At a high level web applications store data and present it to users in a 
useful way. For example, Google stores data about roads and provides 
directions to get from one location to another by driving through the 
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/">Maps</a> application. Driving directions are 
possible because the data is stored in a structured format. </p>
<p>Databases make structured storage reliable and fast. They also give you a 
mental framework for how the data should be saved and retrieved instead of 
having to figure out what to do with the data every time you build a new 
application.</p>
<div class="well see-also">Databases are a concept with many implementations, including <a href="/postgresql.html">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="/mysql.html">MySQL</a> and <a href="/sqlite.html">SQLite</a>. Non-relational databases called <a href="/no-sql-datastore.html">NoSQL data stores</a> also exist.  Learn more in the <a href="/data.html">data</a> chapter or view the <a href="/table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> for all topics.</div>

<h2>Relational databases</h2>
<p>The database storage abstraction most commonly used in Python web development 
is sets of relational tables. Alternative storage abstractions are explained 
on the <a href="/no-sql-datastore.html">NoSQL</a> page.</p>
<p>Relational databases store data in a series of tables. Interconnections
between the tables are specified as <em>foreign keys</em>. A foreign key is a
unique reference from one row in a relational table to another row in
a table, which can be the same table but is most commonly a different table.</p>
<p>Databases storage implementations vary in complexity. SQLite, a database 
included with Python, creates a single file for all data per database. 
Other databases such as <a href="/postgresql.html">PostgreSQL</a>,
<a href="/mysql.html">MySQL</a>, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server have more 
complicated persistence schemes while offering additional advanced features 
that are useful for web application data storage. These advanced
features include but are not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>data replication between a master database and one or more read-only slave 
   instances</li>
<li>advanced column types that can efficiently store semi-structured data
   such as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</li>
<li>sharding, which allows horizontal scaling of multiple databases that 
   each serve as read-write instances at the cost of latency in data
   consistency</li>
<li>monitoring, statistics and other useful runtime information for
   database schemas and tables</li>
</ol>
<p>Typically web applications start with a single database instance such
as PostgreSQL with a straightforward schema. Over time the database 
schema evolves to a more complex structure using schema migrations and 
advanced features such as replication, sharding and monitoring become
more useful as database utilization increases based on the application
users' needs.</p>
<h2>Most common databases for Python web apps</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> and 
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> are two of the most common open source
databases for storing Python web applications' data.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> is a database that is stored in a single
file on disk. SQLite is built into Python but is only built for access
by a single connection at a time. Therefore is highly recommended to not
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/databases/#database-is-locked-errors">run a production web application with SQLite</a>.</p>
<h2>PostgreSQL</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL is the recommended relational database for working with Python
web applications. PostgreSQL's feature set, active development and stability
contribute to its usage as the backend for millions of applications live
on the Web today.</p>
<p>Learn more about using PostgreSQL with Python on the 
<a href="/postgresql.html">PostgreSQL page</a>.</p>
<h2>MySQL</h2>
<p>MySQL is another viable open source database implementation for Python 
applications. MySQL has a slightly easier initial learning curve than 
PostgreSQL but is not as feature rich.</p>
<p>Find out about Python applications with a MySQL backed on the dedicated 
<a href="/mysql.html">MySQL page</a>.</p>
<h2>Connecting to a database with Python</h2>
<p>To work with a relational database using Python, you need to use a code 
library. The most common libraries for relational databases are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/">psycopg2</a> for PostgreSQL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.5">MySQLdb</a> for MySQL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://cx-oracle.sourceforge.net/">cx_Oracle</a> for Oracle</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SQLite support is built into Python 2.7+ and therefore a separate library
is not necessary. Simply "import sqlite3" to begin interfacing with the 
single file-based database.</p>
<h2>Object-relational Mapping</h2>
<p>Object-relational mappers (ORMs) allow developers to access data from a 
backend by writing Python code instead of SQL queries. Each web 
application framework handles integrating ORMs differently. There's 
<a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">an entire page on object-relational mapping</a> 
(ORMs) that you should read to get a handle on this subject.</p>
<h2>Database third-party services</h2>
<p>Numerous companies run scalable database servers as a hosted service.
Hosted databases can often provide automated backups and recovery,
tightened security configurations and easy vertical scaling, depending on the
provider.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)</a>
  provides pre-configured MySQL and PostgreSQL instances. The instances can
  be scaled to larger or smaller configurations based on storage and performance
  needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-sql/">Google Cloud SQL</a> is a service
  with managed, backed up, replicated, and auto-patched MySQL instances. Cloud
  SQL integrates with Google App Engine but can be used independently as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.gobitcan.com/">BitCan</a> provides both MySQL and MongoDB hosted
  databases with extensive backup services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.elephantsql.com/">ElephantSQL</a> is a software-as-a-service company
  that hosts PostgreSQL databases and handles the server configuration, backups
  and data connections on top of Amazon Web Services instances.</p>

<h2>Databases learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install PostgreSQL on your server. Assuming you went with Ubuntu run 
   <code>sudo apt-get install postgresql</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure the <a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/">psycopg2</a> library is in your
   application's dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure your web application to connect to the PostgreSQL instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create models in your ORM, either with Django's 
   <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/">built-in ORM</a> or
   <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy with Flask</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build your database tables or sync the ORM models with the PostgreSQL 
   instance, if you're using an ORM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start creating, reading, updating and deleting data in the database 
   from your web application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>NoSQL Data Stores</h1>
<p>Relational databases store the vast majority of web application 
persistent data. However, there are several alternative classifications of 
storage representations.</p>
<ol>
<li>Key-value pair</li>
<li>Document-oriented</li>
<li>Column-family table</li>
<li>Graph</li>
</ol>
<p>These persistent data storage representations are commonly used to augment,
rather than completely replace, relational databases. The underlying 
persistence type used by the NoSQL database often gives it different
performance characteristics than a relational database, with better results
on some types of read/writes and worse performance on others.</p>
<h2>Key-value Pair</h2>

<h2>Column-family table</h2>
<p>A column-family table class of NoSQL data stores builds on the key-value
pair type. Each key-value pair is considered a row in the store while the
column family is similar to a table in the relational database model.</p>

<h2>Graph</h2>
<p>A graph database represents and stores data in three aspects: nodes, edges
and properties. </p>
<p>A <em>node</em> is an entity, such as a person or business. </p>
<p>An <em>edge</em> is the relationship between two entities. For example, an 
edge could represent that a node for a person entity is an employee of a 
business entity. </p>
<p>A <em>property</em> represents information about nodes. For example, an entity 
representing a person could have a property of "female" or "male".</p>

<h2>NoSQL data stores learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Understand why NoSQL data stores are better for some use cases than 
   relational databases. In general these benefits are only seen at large 
   scale so they may not be applicable to your web application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate Redis into your project for a speed boost over slower persistent 
   storage. Storing session data in memory is generally much faster than 
   saving that data in a traditional relational database that uses persistent 
   storage. Note that when memory is flushed the data goes away so anything 
   that needs to be persistent must still be backed up to disk on a regular 
   basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate other use cases such as storing transient logs in a 
   document-oriented data store such as MongoDB.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Object-relational mappers (ORMs)</h1>
<p>An object-relational mapper (ORM) is a code library that automates the
transfer of data stored in relational databases tables into objects that
are more commonly used in application code.</p>
<h2>Why are ORMs useful?</h2>
<p>ORMs provide a high-level abstraction upon a
<a href="/databases.html">relational database</a> that allows a developer to write
Python code instead of SQL to create, read, update and delete data and
schemas in their database. Developers can use the programming language they
are comfortable with to work with a database instead of writing SQL
statements or stored procedures.</p>
<p>For example, without an ORM a developer would write the following SQL
statement to retrieve every row in the USERS table where the
<code>zip_code</code> column is 94107:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE zip_code=94107;
</pre></div>


<p>The equivalent Django ORM query would instead look like the following Python
code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre># obtain everyone in the 94107 zip code and assign to users variable
users = Users.objects.filter(zip_code=94107)
</pre></div>


<p>The ability to write Python code instead of SQL can speed up web application
development, especially at the beginning of a project. The potential
development speed boost comes from not having to switch from Python code
into writing declarative paradigm SQL statements. While some software
developers may not mind switching back and forth between languages, it's
typically easier to knock out a prototype or start a web application using
a single programming language.</p>
<p>ORMs also make it theoretically possible to switch an application between
various relational databases. For example, a developer could use 
<a href="/sqlite.html">SQLite</a> for
local development and <a href="/mysql.html">MySQL</a> in production. A production 
application could be switched from MySQL to <a href="/postgresql.html">PostgreSQL</a> with 
minimal code modifications.</p>
<p>In practice however, it's best to use the same database for local development
as is used in production. Otherwise unexpected errors could hit in production
that were not seen in a local development environment. Also, it's rare that
a project would switch from one database in production to another one unless
there was a pressing reason.</p>
<div class="well see-also">While you're learning about ORMs you should also read up on <a href="/deployment.html">deployment</a> and check out the <a href="/application-dependencies.html">application dependencies</a> page.</div>

<h2>Do I have to use an ORM for my web application?</h2>
<p>Python ORM libraries are not required for accessing relational
databases. In fact, the low-level access is typically provided by another
library called a <em>database connector</em>, such as
<a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/">psycopg</a> (for PostgreSQL)
or <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.5">MySQL-python</a> (for
MySQL). Take a look at the table below which shows how ORMs can work with
different web frameworks and connectors and relational databases.</p>
<p><img src="/img/orm-examples.png" width="100%" alt="Examples of how varying Python ORMs can work with different connectors and backends." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>The above table shows for example that SQLAlchemy can work with varying
web frameworks and database connectors. Developers can also use ORMs without
a web framework, such as when creating a data analysis tool or a batch
script without a user interface.</p>
<h2>What are the downsides of using an ORM?</h2>
<p>There are numerous downsides of ORMs, including</p>
<ol>
<li>Impedance mismatch</li>
<li>Potential for reduced performance</li>
<li>Shifting complexity from the database into the application code</li>
</ol>
<h3>Impedance mismatch</h3>
<p>The phrase "impedance mismatch" is commonly used in conjunction with ORMs.
Impedance mismatch is a catch-all term for the difficulties that occur when
moving data between relational tables and application objects. The gist
is that the way a developer uses objects is different from how data is
stored and joined in relational tables.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/impedanceMismatch.html">This article on ORM impedance mismatch</a>
does a solid job of explaing what the concept is at a high level and
provides diagrams to visualize why the problem occurs.</p>
<h3>Potential for reduced performance</h3>
<p>One of the concerns that's associated with any higher-level abstraction or
framework is potential for reduced performance. With ORMs, the performance
hit comes from the translation of application code into a corresponding SQL
statement which may not be tuned properly.</p>
<p>ORMs are also often easy to try but difficult to master. For example, a
beginner using Django might not know about the
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/querysets/#select-related"><code>select_related()</code> function</a>
and how it can improve some queries' foreign key relationship performance.
There are dozens of performance tips and tricks for every ORM. It's possible
that investing time in learning those quirks may be better spent just
learning SQL and how to write stored procedures.</p>
<p>There's a lot of hand-waving "may or may not" and "potential for" in this
section. In large projects ORMs are good enough for roughly 80-90% of use
cases but in 10-20% of a project's database interactions there can be
major performance improvements by having a knowledgeable database
administrator write tuned SQL statements to replace the ORM's generated
SQL code.</p>
<h3>Shifting complexity from the database into the app code</h3>
<p>The code for working with an application's data has to live somewhere. Before
ORMs were common, database stored procedures were used to encapsulate the
database logic. With an ORM, the data manipulation code instead lives within
the application's Python codebase. The addition of data handling logic in the
codebase generally isn't an issue with a sound application design, but it does
increase the total amount of Python code instead of splitting code between
the application and the database stored procedures.</p>
<h2>Python ORM Implementations</h2>
<p>There are numerous ORM implementations written in Python, including</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/db/">The Django ORM</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://peewee.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Peewee</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ponyorm.com/">PonyORM</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sqlobject.org/">SQLObject</a></li>
</ol>
<p>There are other ORMs, such as Canonical's
<a href="https://storm.canonical.com/">Storm</a>, but most of them do not appear to
currently be under active development. Learn more about the major active
ORMs below.</p>
<h3>Django's ORM</h3>
<p>The <a href="/django.html">Django</a> web framework comes with
its own built-in object-relational mapping module, generally referred to
as "the Django ORM" or "Django's ORM".</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/">Django's ORM</a> works well
for simple and medium-complexity database operations. However, there are often
complaints that the ORM makes complex queries much more complicated than
writing straight SQL or using <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>.</p>
<p>It's technically possible to drop down to SQL but it ties the queries to a
specific database implementation. The ORM is coupled closely with Django so
replacing the default ORM with SQLAlchemy is currently a hack workaround. Note
though that some of the Django core committers believe it is only a matter of
time before the default ORM is replaced with SQLAlchemy. It will be a large
effort to get that working though so it's likely to come in
<a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com/issues/48">Django 1.9 or later</a>.</p>
<p>Since the majority of Django projects are tied to the default ORM, it's best to
read up on advanced use cases and tools for doing your best work within the
existing framework.</p>
<h3>SQLAlchemy</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> is a well-regarded
Python ORM because it gets the abstraction level "just right" and
seems to make complex database queries easier to write than the Django
ORM in most cases. SQLAlchemy is typically used with Flask as the database
ORM via the <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/">Flask-SQLAlchemy</a>
extension.</p>
<h3>Peewee</h3>
<p><a href="https://peewee.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Peewee</a> is a Python ORM
written to be
"<a href="http://charlesleifer.com/blog/the-case-for-peewee-small-hackable-and-fun/">simpler, smaller and more hackable</a>"
than SQLAlchemy. The analogy used by the core Peewee author is that Peewee
is to SQLAlchemy as SQLite is to PostgreSQL. An ORM does not have to work
for every exhaustive use case in order to be useful.</p>
<h3>Pony</h3>
<p><a href="http://ponyorm.com/">Pony ORM</a> is another Python ORM with a slight twist in
its licensing model. The project is multi-licensed. Pony is free for use
on open source projects but has a
<a href="http://ponyorm.com/license-and-pricing.html">commercial license</a> that
is required for commercial projects. The license is a one-time payment
and does not necessitate a recurring fee.</p>
<h3>SQLObject</h3>
<p><a href="http://sqlobject.org/">SQLObject</a> is an ORM that has been under active
open source development since
<a href="http://sqlobject.org/News1.html#sqlobject-0-5">before 2003</a>.</p>
<h2>Schema migrations</h2>
<p>Schema migrations, for example when you need to add a new column to an
existing table in your database, are not technically part of ORMs. However,
since ORMs typically lead to a hands-off approach to the database (at the
developers peril in many cases), libraries to perform schema migrations
often go hand-in-hand with Python ORM usage on web application projects.</p>
<p>Database schema migrations are a complex topic and deserve their own page.
For now, we'll lump schema migration resources under ORM links below.</p>

          <h1>PostgreSQL</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, often written as "Postgres" and 
pronounced "Poss-gres", is an open source
<a href="/databases.html">relational database</a> implementation frequently used by 
Python applications as a backed for data storage and retrieval.</p>
<p><img src="/img/postgresql.jpg" width="100%" alt="PostgreSQL logo." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<h2>How does PostgreSQL fit within the Python stack?</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL is the default database choice for many Python developers, 
including the Django team when testing the 
<a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">Django ORM</a>. PostgreSQL is often
viewed as more feature robust and stable when compared to MySQL, SQLServer 
and Oracle. All of those databases are reasonable choices. However, because 
PostgreSQL tends to be used by Python developers the drivers and example
code for using the database tend to be better documented and contain fewer
bugs for typical usage scenarios. If you try to use an Oracle database with
Django, you'll see there is far less example code for that setup compared
to PostgreSQL backend setups.</p>
<div class="well see-also">PostgreSQL is an implementation of the <a href="/databases.html">relational database</a> concept. Learn more in the <a href="/data.html">data</a> chapter or view the <a href="/table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> for all topics.</div>

<h2>Why is PostgreSQL a good database choice?</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL's open source license allows developers to operate one or
more databases without licensing cost in their applications. The open 
source license operating model is much less expensive compared to Oracle 
or other proprietary databases, especially as replication and sharding
become necessary at large scale. In addition, because so many people 
ranging from independent developers to multinational organizations use 
PostgreSQL, it's often easier to find developers with PostgreSQL experience 
than other relational databases.</p>
<p>The PostgreSQL core team also releases frequent updates that greatly enhance 
the database's capabilities. For example, in the 
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/release-9-4.html">PostgreSQL 9.4 release</a>
the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/datatype-json.html">jsonb type</a>
was added to enhance JavaScript Object Notation (<a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>)
storage capabilities so that in many cases a separate 
<a href="/no-sql-datastore.html">NoSQL database</a> is not required in an application's
architecture.</p>
<h2>Connecting to PostgreSQL with Python</h2>
<p>To work with relational databases in Python you need to use a database 
driver, which is also referred to as a database connector. The most common 
driver library for working with PostgreSQL is 
<a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/">psycopg2</a>. There is 
<a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Python">a list of all drivers on the PostgreSQL wiki</a>,
including several libraries that are no longer maintained. If you're
working with the 
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio.html">asyncio Python stdlib module</a> 
you should also take a look at the 
<a href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiopg">aiopg</a> library which
wraps psycopg2's asychronouos features together.</p>
<p>To abstract the connection between tables and objects, many Python 
developers use an 
<a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">object-relational mapper (ORM)</a> with 
to turn relational data from PostgreSQL into objects that can be used in
their Python application. For example, while PostgreSQL provides a 
relational database and psycopg is the common database connector, there
are many ORMs that can be used with varying web frameworks, as shown in the
table below.</p>
<p><img src="/img/postgresql-orm-examples.png" width="100%" alt="Examples of how varying Python ORMs can work with PostgreSQL and the psycopg2 connector." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>Learn more about 
<a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">Python ORMs on that dedicated topic page</a>.</p>
<h2>PostgreSQL data safety</h2>
<p>If you're on Linux it's easy to get PostgreSQL installed using a package manager.
However, once the database is installed and running your responsibility is just beginning.
Before you go live with a production application, make sure to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lock down access with 
   <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html">a whitelist</a> 
   in the <code>pg_hba.conf</code> file </li>
<li>Enable <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-master-slave-replication-on-postgresql-on-an-ubuntu-12-04-vps">replication</a>
   to another database that's preferrably on different infrastructure in 
   a separate location</li>
<li>Perform regular 
   <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/backup.html">backups and test the restoration process</a></li>
<li>Ensure your application prevents 
   <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection">SQL injection attacks</a></li>
</ol>
<p>When possible have someone qualified do a 
<a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/2517/postgresql-security-audit">PostgreSQL security audit</a>
to identify the biggest risks to your database. Small applications and 
bootstrapped companies often cannot afford a full audit in the beginning but
as an application grows over time it becomes a bigger target.</p>
<p>The data stored in your database is the lifeblood of your application. If you have
ever 
<a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/02/introducing-developer-evangelist-matt-makai.html">accidentally dropped a production database</a> 
or been the victim of malicious activity such as SQL injection attacks, you'll
know it's far easier to recover when a bit of work has been performed 
beforehand on backups, replication and security measures.</p>

          <h1>MySQL</h1>
<p>MySQL is an open source <a href="/databases.html">relational database</a> 
implementation for storing and retrieving data.</p>
<p><img src="/img/mysql.png" width="100%" alt="MySQL logo." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<h2>MySQL or PostgreSQL?</h2>
<p>MySQL is a viable open source database implementation for Python web 
applications. MySQL has a slightly easier initial learning curve than 
<a href="/postgresql.html">PostgreSQL</a>. However, PostgreSQL's design is often 
preferred by Python web developers, especially when data migrations are
run as an application evolves.</p>
<div class="well see-also">MySQL is an implementation of the <a href="/databases.html">relational database</a> concept. Learn more in the <a href="/data.html">data</a> chapter or view the <a href="/table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> for all topics.</div>

<h2>Python Drivers for MySQL</h2>
<p>Accessing MySQL from a Python application requires a database driver (also
called a "connector"). While it is possible to write a driver as part of
your application, in practice most developers use an existing open source 
driver.</p>
<p>There was a major issue with MySQL drivers since the introduction of 
Python 3. One of the most popular libraries called 
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.5">MySQLdb</a> did not work
in its existing form with Python 3 and there were no plans to update it.
Therefore a fork of MySQLdb named 
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mysqlclient">mysqlclient</a> added Python 3
compatibility. </p>
<p>The mysqlclient fork was good in that existing MySQLdb users could drop
mysqlclient into existing projects that were upgrading to Python 3. However,
the fork often causes confusion when searching for which Python driver to
use with MySQL. Many developer simply decide to use 
<a href="/postgresql.html">PostgreSQL</a> because there is better support for Python
drivers in the PostgreSQL community. </p>
<p>With that driver support context in mind, it's absolutely possible to build
a Python 3 web application with MySQL as a backend. Here is a list of
drivers along with whether it supports Python 2, 3 or both.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://mysqlclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">mysqlclient</a> is a fork
  of MySQLdb that supports Python 2 and 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/">MySQL Connector</a>
  is Oracle's "official" (Oracle currently owns MySQL) Python connector.
  The driver supports Python 2 and 3, just make sure to check the 
  <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/">version guide</a> for what
  releases work with which Python versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.5">MySQLdb</a> supports
  Python 2 and was frequently used by Python web applications before the
  mass migration to Python 3 began.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL">PyMySQL</a> is a pure Python 
  (no C low-level code) implementation that attempts to be a drop-in
  replacement for MySQLdb. However, some MySQL APIs are not supported
  by the driver so whether or not your application can use this connector
  will depend on what you're building.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What organizations use MySQL?</h2>
<p>The database is deployed in production at some of the highest 
trafficked sites such as 
<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2012/mysql-twitter">Twitter</a>, 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/mysql-and-database-engineering-mark-callaghan/10150599729938920">Facebook</a>
and <a href="http://www.mysql.com/customers/">many others major organizations</a>.
However, since
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL_AB">MySQL AB</a>, the company that 
developed MySQL, was purchased by Sun Microsystems (which was in turn 
purchased by Oracle), there have been major defections away from the 
database by 
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/wikipedia-moving-from-mysql-to-mariadb-7000008912/">Wikipedia</a> 
and <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/09/14/google-waves-goodbye-to-mysql-in-favor-of-mariadb">Google</a>. 
MySQL remains a viable database option but I always recommend new Python 
developers learn PostgreSQL if they do not already know MySQL.</p>

          <h1>Application Programming Interfaces</h1>
<p>Application programming interfaces (APIs) provide machine-readable
data transfer and signaling between applications.</p>
<h2>Why are APIs important?</h2>
<p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript create human-readable webpages. However, those 
webpages are not easily consumable by other machines.</p>
<p>Numerous scraping programs and libraries exist to rip data out of HTML but 
it's simpler to consume data through APIs. For example, if you want the
content of a news article it's easier to get the content through an API than
to scrap the text out of the HTML.</p>
<h2>Key API concepts</h2>
<p>There are several key concepts that get thrown around in the APIs world. It's
best to understand these ideas first before diving into the API literature.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Representation State Transfer (REST)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Webhooks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and Extensible Markup Language (XML)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Endpoints</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Webhooks</h2>
<p>A webhook is a user-defined HTTP callback to a URL that executes when a 
system condition is met. The call alerts the second system via a POST or GET
request and often passes data as well.</p>
<p>Webhooks are important because they enable two-way communication initiation 
for APIs. Webhook flexibility comes in from their definition by the API user
instead of the API itself.</p>
<p>For example, in the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/api">Twilio API</a> when a text 
message is sent to a Twilio phone number Twilio sends an HTTP POST request 
webhook to the URL specified by the user. The URL is defined in a text box
on the number's page on Twilio as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="/img/twilio-webhook-definition.jpg" width="100%" alt="Webhook definition in the Twilio API." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<h2>API open source projects</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core">Swagger</a> is an open source project 
  written in Scala that defines a standard interface for RESTful APIs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>API resources</h2>

<h2>APIs learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Learn the API concepts of machine-to-machine communication with JSON and 
   XML, endpoints and webhooks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate an API such as Twilio or Stripe into your web application. 
   Read the <a href="/api-integration.html">API integration</a> section for more 
   information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a framework to create an API for your own application. Learn about
   web API frameworks on the <a href="/api-creation.html">API creation</a> page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expose your web application's API so other applications can consume data 
   you want to share.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>API Integration</h1>
<p>The majority of production Python web applications rely on several
externally hosted application programming interfaces (APIs). APIs are also
commonly referred to as third party services or external platforms. 
Examples include <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/">Twilio</a> for messaging and 
voice services, <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api">Stripe</a> for payment processing 
and <a href="https://disqus.com/api/docs/">Disqus</a> for embedded webpage comments.</p>
<p>There are many articles about proper API design but best practices for 
integrating APIs is less commonly written about. However, this subject 
continuously grows in importance because APIs provide critical functionality
across many implementation areas.</p>
<h2>Hosted API testing services</h2>
<ul>

<p><a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a> is a service specifically designed
  for APIs that assists developers with automated testing and traffic
  inspection.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>API integration learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pick an API known for top notch documentation. Here's a list of 
   <a href="https://medium.com/she-hacks-hacker-academy/4d3c43be9386">ten APIs that are a good starting point for beginners</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read the API documentation for your chosen API. Figure out a simple 
   use case for how your application could be improved by using that API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before you start writing any code, play around with the API through the 
   commandline with <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</a> or in the browser with 
   <a href="http://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>. This exercise will help you get 
   a better understanding of API authentication and the data required for 
   requests and responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate whether to use a helper library or work with 
   <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">Requests</a>. Helper libraries 
   are usually easier to get started with while Requests gives you more 
   control over the HTTP calls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move your API calls into a <a href="/task-queues.html">task queue</a> so they do not 
   block the HTTP request-response cycle for your web application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>API Creation</h1>
<p>Creating and exposing APIs allows your web application to interact with other
applications through machine-to-machine communication.</p>
<h2>API creation frameworks</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.django-rest-framework.org/">Django REST framework</a> and
  <a href="https://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Tastypie</a> are 
  the two most widely used API frameworks to use with Django. The edge
  currently goes to Django REST framework based on rough community sentiment.
  Django REST framework continues to knock out great releases after the
  <a href="http://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/3.0-announcement/">3.0 release mark</a> 
  when Tom Christie ran a 
  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tomchristie/django-rest-framework-3">successful Kickstarter campaign</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://flask-restful.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Flask-RESTful</a> is

<h2>API creation learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pick an API framework appropriate for your web framework. For Django I 
   recommend Django REST framework and for Flask I recommend Flask-RESTful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Begin by building out a simple use case for the API. Generally the use 
   case will either involve data that users want in a machine-readable 
   format or a backend for alternative clients such as an iOS or Android 
   mobile app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add an authentication mechanism through OAuth or a token scheme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add rate limiting to the API if data usage volume could be a performance 
   issue. Also add basic metrics so you can determine how often the API is 
   being accessed and whether it is performing properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide ample documentation and a walkthrough for how the API can be 
   accessed and used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Figure out other use cases and expand based on what you learned with the 
   initial API use case.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Deployment</h1>
<p>Deployment involves packaging up your web application and putting it in a 
production environment that can run the app.</p>
<h2>Why is deployment necessary?</h2>
<p>Your web application must live somewhere other than your own desktop or 
laptop. A production environment is the canonical version of your current 
application and its associated data.</p>
<h2>Deployment topics map</h2>
<p>Python web application deployments are comprised of many pieces that need to
be individually configured. Here is a map that visually depicts how each
deployment topic relates to each other. Click the image to pull up a PDF 
version.</p>
<p><a href="/full-stack-python-map.pdf" target="_blank" style="border: none;"><img src="/img/full-stack-python-map.png" width="100%" alt="Full Stack Python site map." class="technical-diagram" /></a></p>
<h2>Deployment hosting options</h2>
<p>There are four options for deploying and hosting a web application:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="/servers.html">"Bare metal" servers</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/servers.html">Virtualized servers</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/servers.html">Infrastructure-as-a-service</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/platform-as-a-service.html">Platform-as-a-service</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first three options are similar. The deployer needs to provision one or
more servers with a Linux distribution. System packages, a web server, 
WSGI server, database and the Python environment are then installed. Finally
the application can be pulled from source and installed in the environment.</p>
<p>Note that there are other ways of installing a Python web application through
system-specific package management systems. We won't cover those in this
guide as they are considered advanced deployment techniques.</p>
<h2>Deployment resources</h2>
<ul>

<h2>Deployment learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you're tight on time look at the 
   <a href="/platform-as-a-service.html">platform-as-a-service (PaaS)</a> options. You 
   can deploy a low traffic project web app for free or low cost. You won't 
   have to worry about setting up the operating system and web server 
   compared to going the traditional server route. In theory you should be 
   able to get your application live on the web sooner with PaaS hosting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/servers.html">Traditional server options</a> are your best bet for learning
   how the entire Python web stack works. You'll often save money with a 
   virtual private server instead of a platform-as-a-service as you scale up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read about servers, <a href="/operating-systems.html">operating systems</a>, 
   <a href="/web-servers.html">web servers</a> and <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI servers</a> 
   to get a broad picture of what components need to be set up to run a 
   Python web application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Servers</h1>
<p>Servers are the physical infrastructure to run all the layers of software
so your web application can respond to requests from clients such as web 
browsers.</p>
<h2>Why are servers necessary?</h2>
<p>Your web application must live somewhere other than your own desktop or 
laptop. Servers should ideally be accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 
with no unplanned downtime. The servers that host your web application for
actual users (as opposed to test users) are known as <em>production</em> servers.
Production servers hold real data (again as opposed to test data) and must be 
secure against unauthorized access.</p>
<h2>Bare metal servers</h2>
<p>The term <em>bare metal</em> refers to purchasing the actual hardware and hooking 
it up to the Internet either through a business-class internet service 
provider (ISP) or 
<a href="http://webdesign.about.com/od/colocation/a/what_colocation.htm">co-locating the server</a>
with other servers. A "business-class" ISP is necessary because
most residential Internet service agreements explicitly prohibit running
web servers on their networks. You may be able to get away with low traffic
volume but if your site serves a lot of traffic it will alert an ISP's
filters.</p>
<p>The bare metal option offers the most control over the server configuration,
usually has the highest performance for the price, but also is the most
expensive upfront option and the highest ongoing maintenance. With bare
metal servers the ongoing operating cost is the electricity the server(s)
use as well as handling repairs when server components malfunction. You're
taking on manual labor working with hardware as well as the rest of the
software stack.</p>
<p>Buy actual hardware from a vendor either pre-built or as a collection of 
components that you assemble yourself. You can also buy 
pre-configured servers from Dell or HP. Those servers tend to be in
smaller case form factors (called "blades") but are correspondingly more 
expensive than putting off-the-shelf components together yourself in a 
standard computer case.</p>
<h2>Virtualized servers</h2>
<p>Virtual private servers (VPSs) are slices of hardware on top of a larger
bare metal server. Virtualization software such as 
<a href="http://www.xen.org/">Xen</a> and
<a href="http://www.vmware.com/virtualization/what-is-virtualization.html">VMWare</a>
allow providers such as <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> and
<a href="http://prgmr.com/xen/">prgmr</a> (as well as a many others) to provide
fractions of a full server that appear as their own instances. For example,
a server with an 8-core Xeon processor and 16 gigabytes of memory can be
sliced into 8 pieces with the equivalent of 1-core and 2 gigabytes of
memory.</p>
<p>The primary disadvantage of virtualized servers is that there is resource
overhead in the virtualization process. In addition, physical constraints
such as heavy I/O operations by a single virtualized instance on persistent 
storage can cause performance bottlenecks for other virtualized instances on
the shared server. Choosing virtualized server hosting should be based on
your needs for urgency of service ticket requests and the frequency you
require for ongoing maintenance such as persistent storage backups.</p>
<h3>Virtualized servers resources</h3>

  explains how to measure CPU load and what to do about it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Infrastructure-as-a-service</h2>
<p>Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) overlaps with virtualized servers 
because the resources are often presented in the same way. The 
difference between virtualized servers and IaaS is the granularity of the
billing cycle. IaaS generally encourages a finer granularity based on minutes
or hours of server usage instead of on monthly billing cycles.</p>
<p>IaaS can be used in combination with virtualized servers to provide 
dynamic upscaling for heavy traffic. When traffic is low then virtualized
servers can solely be used. This combination of resources reduces cost at
the expense of greater complexity in the dynamically scaled infrastructure. </p>
<p>The most common IaaS platforms are 
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> and 
<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/">Rackspace Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>The disadvantage to IaaS platforms is the lock-in if you have to write
custom code to deploy, dynamically scale, and generally understand your
infrastructure. Every platform has its quirks. For example, 
Amazon's standard <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/">Elastic Block Store</a> storage
infrastructure has at least an order of magnitude worse I/O throughput 
than working with your local disk. Your application's database queries may 
work great locally but then when you deploy the performance is inadequate.
Amazon has <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/07/31/announcing-provisioned-iops-for-amazon-ebs/">higher throughput EBS instances</a>
but you will pay correspondingly more for them. EBS throughput is just 
one of many quirks you need to understand before committing to an 
IaaS platform.</p>

<h2>Servers learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sign up for a hosting provider. I recommend getting a 
   <a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=bfeecaf55a83cd3dd224a5f2a3a001fdf95d4c3d">Linode VPS</a> 
   to set up your initial infrastructure and deploy your web application 
   there. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> and 
   <a href="http://prgmr.com/xen/">prgrmr</a> are other VPS options. You can change
   hosting providers later after the deployment process is automated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provision your first server. It will be ready but in a shutdown state 
   while awaiting your instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move to the <a href="/operating-systems.html">operating systems</a> section to learn
   how to load Ubuntu 14.04 LTS as a base OS for Python web applications.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Platform-as-a-service</h1>
<p>A platform-as-a-service (PaaS) provides infrastructure and a software layer
on which a web application is deployed. Running your web application from
a PaaS removes the need to know as much about the underlying servers, 
operating system, web server, and often the WSGI server. </p>
<p><em>Note</em>: If you are not interested in deploying to a PaaS you can move 
ahead to the <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI servers</a> section.</p>
<p>The PaaS layer defines how the application accesses resources such as 
computing time, files, and external services. The PaaS provides a 
higher-level abstraction for working with computing resources than deploying 
an application to a server or IaaS.</p>
<p>A PaaS makes deployment and operations easier because it forces the developer
to conform applications to the PaaS architecture. For example, Heroku looks 
for Python's <code>requirements.txt</code> file in the base directory of the repository 
during deployment because that is the file's de facto community standard
location.</p>
<p><img src="/img/servers-versus-paas.png" width="100%" alt="Traditional LAMP server stack versus a Platform-as-a-Service stack" class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>If you go the PaaS route, you can skip configuring an operating system
and web server prebaked into PaaS offerings. PaaS offerings generally start 
at the WSGI server layer. </p>
<h2>Platform-as-a-service responsibilities</h2>
<p>Although PaaS offerings simplify setting up and maintaining the servers,
operating system, and web server, developers still have responsibilities for other
layers of their web stack.</p>
<p>While it's useful to know the operating system that underpins your PaaS, for 
example Heroku uses Ubuntu 10.04, you will not have to know as much about 
securing the operating system and server level. However, web applications deployed
to a PaaS are just as vulnerable to security breaches at the application level
as a standard LAMP stack. It's still your responsibility to ensure the web
application framework and your app itself is up to date and secured. See the
<a href="/web-application-security.html">security section</a> for further information.</p>

<h2>Platform-as-a-service learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Review the potential Python platform-as-a-service options listed above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sign up for a PaaS account at the provider that appears to best fit your
   application needs. Heroku is the PaaS option recommended for starters due 
   to their detailed documentation and walkthroughs available on the web. 
   However, the other options are also viable since their purpose is to make 
   deploying applications as easy as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check if there are any PaaS-specific configuration files needed for your 
   app to run properly on the PaaS after it is deployed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deploy your app to the PaaS. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sync your application's configuration with the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up a content delivery network for your application's 
   <a href="/static-content.html">static content</a> unless your PaaS provider already
   handles this deployment step for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check if the application's functionality is working and tweak as necessary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Operating Systems</h1>
<p>An operating system runs on the server or virtual server and controls access 
to computing resources. The operating system also includes a way to install
programs necessary for running your Python web application.</p>
<h2>Why are operating systems necessary?</h2>
<p>An operating system makes many of the computing tasks we take for granted 
easy. For example, the operating system enables writing to files, 
communicating over a network and running multiple programs at once. 
Otherwise you'd need to control the CPU, memory, network, graphics card, 
and many other components with your own low-level implementation.</p>
<p>Without using an existing operating system like Linux, Mac OS X or Windows,
you'd be forced to write a new operating system as part of your web 
application.  It would be impossible to write features for your Python 
web application because you'd be too busy hunting down a memory leak in 
your assembly code, if you even were able to get that far.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the open source community provides Linux to the Python world 
as a rock solid free operating system for running our applications.</p>
<h2>Recommended operating systems</h2>
<p>The only recommended operating system for production Python web stack 
deployments is Linux. There are several Linux distributions commonly used 
for running production servers. Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) releases, 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and CentOS are all viable options. </p>
<p>Mac OS X is fine for development activities. Windows and Mac 
OS X are not appropriate for production deployments unless there is a 
major reason why you must use them in lieu of Linux.</p>
<h3>Ubuntu</h3>
<p>Ubuntu is a Linux distribution packaged by the 
<a href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical Ltd</a> company. Ubuntu uses the
Debian distribution as a base for packages, including the 
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Apt">aptitude package manager</a>. For desktop versions 
of Ubuntu, GNOME (until the 11.04 release) or Unity (11.10 through current)
is bundled with the distribution to provide a user interface.</p>
<p>Ubuntu <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS">Long Term Support</a> (LTS) releases
are the recommended versions to use for deployments. LTS versions receive
five years of post-release updates from Canonical. Every two years, Canonical 
creates a new LTS release, which allows for an easy upgrade path as well 
as flexibility in skipping every other LTS release if necessary. As of
April 2016, 
<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/ReleaseNotes">16.04 Xenial Xerus</a>
is the latest Ubuntu LTS release. Xenial Xerus includes 
<a href="/python-2-or-3.html">Python 3.5</a> as its default Python version, which is
a major update compared with 2.7 in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.</p>
<h4>Ubuntu Python Packages</h4>
<p>There are several 
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/aptitude.html">Aptitude</a>
packages found on Linux servers running a Python stack. These packages are: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/python-dev">python-dev</a> for header
  files and static library for Python</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/python-virtualenv">python-virtualenv</a>
  for creating and managing Python 
  <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">virtualenvs</a> to isolate library
  dependencies</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Red Hat and CentOS</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.redhat.com/products/enterprise-linux/">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a>
(RHEL) and <a href="http://www.centos.org/">Community ENTerprise Operating System</a>
(CentOS) are the same distribution. The primary difference between the two 
is that CentOS is an open source, liberally licensed free derivative of RHEL.</p>
<p>RHEL and CentOS use a different package manager and command-line interface 
from Debian-based Linux distributions: RPM Package Manager (RPM) and the 
Yellowdog Updater, Modified (YUM). RPM has a specific .rpm file format
to handle the packaging and installation of libraries and applications. YUM
provides a command-line interface for interacting with the RPM system.</p>

<h2>Operating system learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Choose either a Debian-based Linux distribution such as Ubuntu or a 
   Fedora-based distribution like CentOS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harden the security through a few basic steps. Install basic security 
   packages such as 
   <a href="http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">fail2ban</a> and
   <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates">unattended-upgrades</a>.
   Create a new user account with sudo privileges and disable
   root logins. Disable password-only logins and use a public-private keypair 
   instead. Read more about hardening systems in the resources listed below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install Python-specific packages to prepare the environment for running a
   Python application. Which packages you'll need to install depends on the 
   distribution you've selected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read up on <a href="/web-servers.html">web servers</a> as installing one will be the 
   next step in the deployment process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Web servers</h1>
<p>Web servers respond to 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</a> (HTTP)
requests from clients and send back a response containing a status code and
often content such as HTML, XML or JSON as well.</p>
<h2>Why are web servers necessary?</h2>
<p>Web servers are the ying to the web client's yang. The server and client speak
the standardized language of the World Wide Web. This standard language
is why an old Mozilla Netscape browser can still talk to a modern Apache or
Nginx web server, even if it cannot properly render the page design like a 
modern web browser can. </p>
<p>The basic language of the Web with the request and response cycle from 
client to server then server back to client remains the same as it was when
the Web was invented by 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</a> at CERN in 1989.
Modern browsers and web servers have simply extended the language of the Web
to incorporate new standards.</p>
<h2>Web server implementations</h2>
<p>The conceptual web server idea can be implemented in various ways. The 
following web server implementations each have varying features, extensions
and configurations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="/apache-http-server.html">Apache HTTP Server</a> has been the most 
  commonly deployed web server on the Internet for 20+ years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/nginx.html">Nginx</a> is the second most commonly used server for the
  top 100,000 websites and often serves as a reverse proxy for 
  <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">Python WSGI servers</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/caddy.html">Caddy</a> is a newcomer to the web server scene
  and is focused on serving the HTTP/2 protocol with HTTPS. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Client requests</h2>
<p>A client that sends a request to a web server is usually a browser such 
as Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Chrome, but it can also be a</p>
<ul>
<li>headless browser, commonly use for testing, such as 
  <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">phantomjs</a></li>
<li>commandline utility, for example <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a>
  and <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</a></li>
<li>text-based web browser such as 
  <a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx</a></li>
<li>web crawler. </li>
</ul>
<p>Web servers process requests from the above clients. The result of the web
server's processing is a 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/Response_codes">response code</a>
and commonly a content response. Some status codes, such as 204 (No content) 
and 403 (Forbidden), do not have content responses.</p>
<p>In a simple case, the client will request a static asset such as a picture
or JavaScript file. The file sits on the file system in a location the
web server is authorized to access and the web server sends the file
to the client with a 200 status code. If the client already requested the
file and the file has not changed, the web server will pass back a 304 
"Not modified" response indicating the client already has the latest version
of that file.</p>
<p><img src="/img/web-browser-server-requests.png" width="100%" class="technical-diagram" alt="Web server and web browser request-response cycle" /></p>
<p>A web server sends files to a web browser based on the web browser's 
request. In the first request, the browser accessed the 
"www.fullstackpython.com"
address and the server responded with the index.html HTML-formatted file. 
That HTML file contained references to other files, such as style.css and 
script.js that the browser then requested from the server.</p>
<p>Sending static assets (such as CSS and JavaScript files) can eat up a 
large amount of bandwidth which is why using a Content Delivery Network 
(CDN) to <a href="/static-content.html">serve static assets</a> is important when 
possible.</p>

<h2>Web servers learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Choose a web server. <a href="http://nginx.org/en/">Nginx</a> is often recommended 
   although <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> is also a great choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an SSL certificate. For testing use a self-signed certificate 
   and for a production app buy one from <a href="http://www.digicert.com/">Digicert</a>. 
   Configure the web server to serve traffic over SSL. You'll need SSL for 
   serving only HTTPS traffic and preventing security issues that occur with 
   unencrypted user input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure the web server to serve up static files such as CSS, JavaScript
   and images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you set up the <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI server</a> you'll need to 
   configure the web server as a pass through for dynamic content.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>WSGI Servers</h1>
<p>A <a href="http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Web Server Gateway Interface</a>
(WSGI) server implements the web server side of the WSGI interface for
running Python web applications. </p>
<h2>Why is WSGI necessary?</h2>
<p>A traditional web server does not understand or have any way to run Python 
applications. In the late 1990s, a developer named Grisha Trubetskoy 
<a href="http://grisha.org/blog/2013/10/25/mod-python-the-long-story/">came up with an Apache module called mod_python</a> 
to execute arbitrary Python code. For several years in the late 1990s 
and early 2000s, Apache configured with mod_python ran most Python web 
applications.</p>
<p>However, mod_python wasn't a standard specification. It was just an 
implementation that allowed Python code to run on a server. As mod_python's 
development stalled and security vulnerabilities were discovered there 
was recognition by the community that a consistent way to execute Python 
code for web applications was needed.</p>
<p>Therefore the Python community came up with WSGI as a standard interface that
modules and containers could implement. WSGI is now the accepted approach 
for running Python web applications.</p>
<p><img src="/img/wsgi-interface.png" alt="WSGI server invoking a WSGI application." width="100%" class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>As shown in the above diagram, a WSGI server simply invokes a callable object
on the WSGI application as defined by the PEP 3333 standard.</p>
<h2>WSGI's Purpose</h2>
<p>Why use WSGI and not just point a web server directly at an application?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>WSGI gives you flexibility</strong>. Application developers can swap out
  web stack components for others. For example, a developer can switch from 
  Green Unicorn to uWSGI without modifying the application or framework 
  that implements WSGI. 
  From <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/">PEP 3333</a>:</p>
<p>The availability and widespread use of such an API in web servers for 
Python [...] would separate choice of framework from choice of web 
server, freeing users to choose a pairing that suits them, while 
freeing framework and server developers to focus on their preferred 
area of specialization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>WSGI servers promote scaling</strong>. Serving thousands of requests for dynamic
  content at once is the domain of WSGI servers, not frameworks.
  WSGI servers handle processing requests from the web server and deciding
  how to communicate those requests to an application framework's process.
  The segregation of responsibilities is important for efficiently scaling 
  web traffic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/web-browser-server-wsgi.png" alt="WSGI Server - Web server - Browser" width="100%" class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>WSGI is by design a simple standard interface for running Python code. As
a web developer you won't need to know much more than</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>what WSGI stands for (Web Server Gateway Inteface)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that a WSGI container is a separate running process that runs on a
  different port than your web server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your web server is configured to pass requests to the WSGI container which
  runs your web application, then pass the response (in the form of HTML)
  back to the requester</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're using a standard web framework such as Django, Flask, or
Bottle, or almost any other current Python framework, you don't need to worry
about how frameworks implement the application side of the WSGI standard.
Likewise, if you're using a standard WSGI container such as Green Unicorn,
uWSGI, mod_wsgi, or gevent, you can get them running without worrying about
how they implement the WSGI standard.</p>
<p>However, knowing the WSGI standard and how these frameworks and containers
implement WSGI should be on your learning checklist though as you become
a more experienced Python web developer.</p>
<h2>Official WSGI specifications</h2>
<p>The WSGI standard v1.0 is specified in
<a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/">PEP 0333</a>. As of September 2010,
WSGI v1.0 is superseded by
<a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/">PEP 3333</a>, which defines the
v1.0.1 WSGI standard. If you're working with Python 2.x and you're compliant
with PEP 0333, then you're also compliant with 3333. The newer version is
simply an update for Python 3 and has instructions for how unicode should
be handled.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/wsgiref.html">wsgiref in Python 2.x</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/wsgiref.html">wsgiref in Python 3.x</a>
are the reference implementations of the WSGI specification built into
Python's standard library so it can be used to build WSGI servers and
applications.</p>
<h2>Example web server configuration</h2>
<p>A web server's configuration specifies what requests should be passed to
the WSGI server to process. Once a request is processed and generated by the
WSGI server, the response is passed back through the web server and onto
the browser. </p>
<p>For example, this Nginx web server's configuration specifies that
Nginx should handle static assets (such as images, JavaScript, and CSS
files) under the /static directory and pass all other requests to the WSGI
server running on port 8000:</p>

<h2>WSGI servers learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Understand that WSGI is a standard Python specification for applications 
   and servers to implement. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick a WSGI server based on available documentation and tutorials. Green 
   Unicorn is a good one to start with since it's been around for awhile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the WSGI server to your server deployment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure the web server to pass requests to the WSGI server for 
   appropriate URL patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test that the WSGI server responds to local requests but not direct 
   requests outside your infrastructure. The web server should be the pass 
   through for requests to and responses from the WSGI server.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Source control</h1>
<p>Source control, also known as <em>version control</em>, stores software code files
with a detailed history of every modification made to those files.</p>
<h2>Why is source control necessary?</h2>
<p>Version control systems allow developers to modify code without worrying 
about permanently screwing something up. Unwanted changes can be easily rolled
back to previous working versions of the code. </p>
<p>Source control also makes team software development easier. One developer 
can combine her code modifications with other developers' code through 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diff</a> views that show line-by-line 
changes then merge the appropriate code into the main code branch.</p>
<p>Version control is a necessity on all software projects regardless of 
development time, codebase size or the programming language used. Every
project should immediately begin by using a version control system such
as Git or Mercurial.</p>
<h2>Source control during deployment</h2>
<p>Pulling code during a deployment is a potential way source control systems fit
into the deployment process. </p>
<p><img src="/img/app-source-control.png" width="100%" class="technical-diagram" alt="App deployment uses a server to pull from the source control system."></p>
<p>Note that some developers recommend deployment pipelines package the source 
code to deploy it and never have a production environment touch a source 
control system directly. However, for small scale deployments it's often
easiest to pull from source code when you're getting started instead of 
figuring out how to wrap the Python code in a system installation package.</p>
<h2>Source control projects</h2>
<p>Numerous source control systems have been created over the past several
decades. In the past, proprietary source control software offered features
tailored to large development teams and specific project workflows. However,
open source systems are now used for version control on the largest and most
complicated software projects in existence. There's no reason why your project
should use anything other than an open source version control system in
today's Python development world. The two primary choices are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a free and open source distributed version
  control system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> is similar to Git, also a free
  and open source distributed version control system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hosted source control services</h2>
<p>Git and Mercurial can be downloaded and run on your own server. However,
it's easy and cheap to get started with a hosted version control service.
You can transition away from the service at a later time by moving your 
repositories if your needs change. A couple of recommended hosted version
control services are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> has both a self-hosted version of its
  open source software as well as their hosted version with 
  <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/">pricing</a> for businesses that need
  additional hosting support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> provides free open source repositories 
  and paid private repositories for Git.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> also has free Git and Mercurial 
  repositories for open projects, but adds private repositories for up to 
  five users. Users pay for hosting private repositories with more than 
  five users.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Source control learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pick a version control system. Git is recommended because on the web there
   are a significant number of tutorials to help both new and advanced users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn basic use cases for version control such as committing changes, 
   rolling back to earlier file versions and searching for when lines of code 
   were modified during development history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure your source code is backed up in a central repository. A central
   repository is critical not only if your local development version is 
   corrupted but also for the deployment process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate source control into your deployment process in three ways. First,
   pull the project source code from version control during deployments. 
   Second, kick off deployments when code is modified by using webhooks or 
   polling on the repository. Third, ensure you can roll back to a previous 
   version if a code deployment goes wrong.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Application Dependencies</h1>
<p>Application dependencies are the libraries other than your project code
that are required to create and run your application. </p>
<h2>Why are application dependencies important?</h2>
<p>Python web applications are built upon the work done by thousands of open
source programmers. Application dependencies include not only web frameworks but
also libraries for scraping, parsing, processing, analyzing, visualizing, 
and many other tasks. Python's ecosystem facilitates discovery, retrieval and 
installation so applications are easier for developers to create.</p>
<h2>Finding libraries</h2>
<p>Python libraries are stored in a central location known as the 
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">Python Package Index</a> (PyPi). PyPi contains
search functionality with results weighted by usage and relevance based on
keyword terms.</p>
<p>Besides PyPi there are numerous resources that list common or "must-have" 
libraries. Ultimately the decision for which application dependencies are
necessary for your project is up to you and the functionality you're looking
to build. However, it's useful to browse through these lists in case you come 
across a library to solve a problem by reusing the code instead of writing it
all yourself. A few of the best collections of Python libraries are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsefulModules">Python.org's useful modules</a>
  which groups modules into categories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/trending?l=python">GitHub Explore Trending repositories</a>
  shows the open source Python projects trending today, this week, and this 
  month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This list of <a href="http://freepythontips.wordpress.com/2013/07/30/20-python-libraries-you-cant-live-without/">20 Python libraries you can’t live without</a>
  is a wide-ranging collection from data analysis to testing tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wikipedia actually has an extensive 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Python_software">page dedicated to Python libraries</a> 
  grouped by categories.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Isolating dependencies</h2>
<p>Dependencies are installed separately from system-level packages to prevent 
library version conflicts. The most common isolation method is 
<a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>. Each virtualenv is its
own copy of the Python interpreter and dependencies in the site-packages
directory. To use a virtualenv it must first be created with the virtualenv
command and then activated.</p>
<p>The virtualenv stores dependencies in an isolated environment. The web 
application then relies only on that virtualenv instance which has a separate
copy of the Python interpreter and site-packages directory. A high level of
how a server configured with virtualenv can look is shown in the picture below.</p>
<p><img src="/img/server-setup.png" alt="How the virtualenv separates dependencies on the server." width="100%" class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<h2>Installing Python dependencies</h2>
<p>The recommended way to install Python library dependencies is with the 
<a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/">pip</a> command when a virtualenv
is activated.</p>
<p>Pip and virtualenv work together and have complementary responsibilities.
Pip downloads and installs application dependencies from the central
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPi</a> repository. </p>
<h2>requirements.txt</h2>
<p>The pip convention for specifying application dependencies is with a 
<code>requirements.txt</code> file. When you build a Python web application you 
should include <code>requirements.txt</code> in the base directory of your project.</p>
<p>Python projects' dependencies for a web application should be specified 
with pegged dependencies like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>django==1.6
bpython==0.12
django-braces==0.2.1
django-model-utils==1.1.0
logutils==0.3.3
South==0.7.6
requests==1.2.0
stripe==1.9.1
dj-database-url==0.2.1
django-oauth2-provider==0.2.4
djangorestframework==2.3.1
</pre></div>


<p>Pegged dependencies with precise version numbers or Git tags are important 
because otherwise the latest version of a dependency will be used. While
it may sound good to stay up to date, there's no telling if your application
actually works with the latest versions of all dependencies. Developers should 
deliberately upgrade and test to make sure there were no backwards-incompatible
modifications in newer dependency library versions.</p>
<h2>setup.py</h2>
<p>There is another type of dependency specification for Python libraries
known as 
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1471994/what-is-setup-py">setup.py</a>.
Setup.py is a standard for distributing and installing Python libraries.
If you're building a Python library, such as 
<a href="http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/underwear">underwear</a> you must include setup.py
so a dependency manager can correctly install both the library as well as
additional dependencies for the library. There's still quite a bit of 
confusion in the Python community over the difference between 
requirements.txt and setup.py, so read this 
<a href="https://caremad.io/2013/07/setup-vs-requirement/">well written post</a> for
further clarification.</p>

<h2>Open source app dependency projects</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv">Autoenv</a> is a tool for activating
  environment variables stored in a <code>.env</code> file in your projects' home
  directories. Environment variables aren't managed by virtualenv and although
  virtualenvwrapper has some hooks for handling them, it's often easiest to
  use a shell script or <code>.env</code> file to set them in a development environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs">Pipreqs</a> searches through a project for
  dependencies based on imports. It then generates a <code>requirements.txt</code> file
  based on the libraries necessary to run those dependencies. Note though that
  while this could come in handy with a legacy project, the version numbers
  for those libraries will not be generated with the output.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Application dependencies learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ensure the libraries your web application depends on are all captured in 
   a requirement.txt file with pegged versions. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An easy way to capture currently installed dependencies is with the 
   <code>pip freeze</code> command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a fresh virtualenv and install the dependencies from your 
   <code>requirements.txt</code> file by using the <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> 
   command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check that your application runs properly with the fresh virtualenv and 
   only the installed dependencies from the <code>requirements.txt</code> file.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Static content</h1>
<p>Some content on a website does not change and therefore should be served
up either directly through the web server or a content delivery network (CDN).
Examples include JavaScript, image, and CSS files.</p>
<h2>Types of static content</h2>
<p>Static content can be either assets created as part of your development
process such as images on your landing page or user-generated content. The 
Django framework calls these two categories <em>assets</em> and <em>media</em>.</p>
<h2>Content delivery networks</h2>
<p>A content delivery network (CDN) is a third party that stores and serves 
static files. <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon CloudFront</a>,
<a href="http://www.akamai.com/">Akamai</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public/files/">Rackspace Cloud Files</a> 
are examples of CDNs. The purpose of a CDN is to remove the load of static
file requests from web servers that are handling dynamic web content. For
example, if you have an nginx server that handles both static files and 
acts as a front for a Green Unicorn WSGI server on a 512 megabyte 
virtual private server, the nginx server will run into resource 
constraints under heavy traffic. A CDN can remove the need to serve static
assets from that nginx server so it can purely act as a pass through for 
requests to the Green Unicorn WSGI server.</p>
<p>CDNs send content responses from data centers with the closest proximity to the requester.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Static content learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify a content delivery network to offload serving static content 
   files from your local web server. I recommend using Amazon S3 with 
   CloudFront as it's easy to set up and will scale to high bandwidth demands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update your web application deployment process so updated static files are
   uploaded to the CDN. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move static content serving from the www subdomain to a static (or 
   similarly named) subdomain so browsers will load static content in 
   parallel to www HTTP requests.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Task queues</h1>
<p>Task queues manage background work that must be executed outside the usual
HTTP request-response cycle.</p>
<h2>Why are task queues necessary?</h2>
<p>Tasks are handled asynchronously either because they are not initiated by 
an HTTP request or because they are long-running jobs that would dramatically
reduce the performance of an HTTP response.</p>
<p>For example, a web application could poll the GitHub API every 10 minutes to
collect the names of the top 100 starred repositories. A task queue would
handle invoking code to call the GitHub API, process the results and store them
in a persistent database for later use.</p>
<p>Another example is when a database query would take too long during the HTTP
request-response cycle. The query could be performed in the background on a
fixed interval with the results stored in the database. When an
HTTP request comes in that needs those results a query would simply fetch the
precalculated result instead of re-executing the longer query.
This precalculation scenario is a form of <a href="/caching.html">caching</a> enabled 
by task queues.</p>
<p>Other types of jobs for task queues include</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>spreading out large numbers of independent database inserts over time 
  instead of inserting everything at once</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aggregating collected data values on a fixed interval, such as every
  15 minutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>scheduling periodic jobs such as batch processes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Task queue projects</h2>
<p>The defacto standard Python task queue is Celery. The other task queue 
projects that arise tend to come from the perspective that Celery is overly
complicated for simple use cases. My recommendation is to put the effort into
Celery's reasonable learning curve as it is worth the time it takes to 
understand how to use the project.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://www.celeryproject.org/">Celery</a> distributed task queue is the
  most commonly used Python library for handling asynchronous tasks and 
  scheduling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://python-rq.org/">RQ (Redis Queue)</a> is a simple Python
  library for queueing jobs and processing them in the background with workers.
  RQ is backed by Redis and is designed to have a low barrier to entry.
  The <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/introducing-rq/">intro post</a> contains information
  on design decisions and how to use RQ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dcramer/taskmaster">Taskmaster</a> is a lightweight simple
  distributed queue for handling large volumes of one-off tasks. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://huey.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Huey</a> is a simple task queue that
  uses Redis on the backend but otherwise does not depend on other libraries. 
  The project was previously known as Invoker and the author changed the name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://huey.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Huey</a> is a Redis-based task 
  queue that aims to provide a simple, yet flexible framework for 
  executing tasks. Huey supports task scheduling, crontab-like repeating 
  tasks, result storage and automatic retry in the event of failure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hosted message and task queue services</h2>
<p>Task queue third party services aim to solve the complexity issues that arise
when scaling out a large deployment of distributed task queues.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.iron.io/">Iron.io</a> is a distributed messaging service platform 
  that works with many types of task queues such as Celery. It also is built
  to work with other IaaS and PaaS environments such as Amazon Web Services
  and Heroku.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)</a> is a
  set of five APIs for creating, sending, receiving, modifying and deleting
  messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.cloudamqp.com/">CloudAMQP</a> is at its core managed servers with
  RabbitMQ installed and configured. This service is an option if you are 
  using RabbitMQ and do not want to maintain RabbitMQ installations on your 
  own servers.</p>

<h2>Task queue learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pick a slow function in your project that is called during an HTTP 
   request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine if you can precompute the results on a fixed interval instead 
   of during the HTTP request. If so, create a separate function you can call
   from elsewhere then store the precomputed value in the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read the Celery documentation and the links in the resources section below
   to understand how the project works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install a message broker such as RabbitMQ or Redis and then add Celery to 
   your project. Configure Celery to work with the installed message broker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Celery to invoke the function from step one on a regular basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have the HTTP request function use the precomputed value instead of the 
   slow running code it originally relied upon.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Configuration Management</h1>
<p>Configuration management involves modifying servers from an existing state to 
a desired state and automating how an application is deployed.</p>
<h2>Configuration management tools</h2>
<p>Numerous tools exist to modify server state in a controlled 
way, including <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet">Puppet</a>, 
<a href="http://www.getchef.com/chef/">Chef</a>, 
<a href="http://www.saltstack.com/">SaltStack</a>, and Ansible. Puppet and Chef are
written in Ruby, while SaltStack and Ansible are written in Python.</p>
<h2>Ad hoc tasks</h2>
<p>Configuration management tools such as Chef, Puppet, Ansible, and SaltStack
are not useful for performing ad hoc tasks that require interactive responses.
<a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.8/">Fabric</a> and 
<a href="http://docs.pyinvoke.org/en/latest/">Invoke</a> are used for interactive 
operations, such as querying the database from the Django manage.py shell.</p>

<h2>Application dependencies learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Learn about configuration management in the context of deployment 
   automation and infrastructure-as-code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick a configuration management tool and stick with it. My recommendation 
   is Ansible because it is by far the easiest tool to learn and use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read your configuration management tool's documentation and, when 
   necessary, the source code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automate the configuration management and deployment for your project. 
   Note that this is by far the most time consuming step in this 
   checklist but will pay dividends every time you deploy your project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hook the automated deployment tool into your existing deployment process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Continuous Integration</h1>
<p>Continuous integration automates the building, testing and deploying of 
applications. Software projects, whether created by a single individual or 
entire teams, typically use continuous integration as a hub to ensure 
important steps such as unit testing are automated rather than manual 
processes.</p>
<h2>Why is continuous integration important?</h2>
<p>When continuous integration (CI) is established as a step in a software 
project's development process it can dramatically reduce deployment times 
by minimizing steps that require human intervention. The only minor downside 
to using CI is that it takes some initial time by a developer to set up and 
then there is some ongoing maintainence if a project is broken into multiple 
parts, such as going from a monolith architecture to 
<a href="/microservices.html">microservices</a>.</p>
<h2>Automated testing</h2>
<p>Another major advantage with CI is that testing can be an automated step in 
the deployment process. Broken deployments can be prevented by running a 
comprehensive test suite of <a href="/unit-testing.html">unit</a> and 
<a href="/integration-testing.html">integration tests</a> when developers check in code 
to a source code repository. Any bugs accidentally introduced during a 
check-in that are caught by the test suite are reported and prevent the 
deployment from proceeding.</p>
<p>The automated testing on checked in source code can be thought of like the 
bumper guards in bowling that prevent code quality from going too far off 
track. CI combined with unit and integration tests check that any code 
modifications do not break existing tests to ensure the software works as 
intended.</p>
<h2>Continuous integration example</h2>
<p>The following picture represents a high level perspective on how continuous
integration and deployment can work. </p>
<p><img src="/img/continuous-integration.png" width="100%" class="technical-diagram" alt="One potential way for continuous integration to work with source control and a deployment environment." /></p>
<p>In the above diagram, when new code is committed to a source repository 
there is a hook that notifies the continuous integration server that new 
code needs to be built (the continuous integration server could also
poll the source code repository if a notification is not possible).</p>
<p>The continuous integration server pulls the code to build and test it. If
all tests pass, the continuous integration server begins the deployment
process. The new code is pulled down to the server where the deployment is
taking place. Finally the deployment process is completed via restarting 
services and related deployment activities.</p>
<p>There are many other ways a continuous integration server and its 
deployments can be structured. The above was just one example of a 
relatively simple set up.</p>
<h2>Open source CI projects</h2>
<p>There are a variety of free and open source continuous integration servers 
that are configurable based on a project's needs. </p>
<p>Note that many of these servers are not written in Python but work 
just fine for Python applications. Polyglot organizations (ones that 
use more than a single language and ecosystem) often use a single CI 
server for all of their  projects regardless of the programming language 
the application was written in.</p>

          <h1>Logging</h1>
<p>Logging saves output such as errors, warnings and event information to 
persistent storage for debugging purposes. </p>
<h2>Why is logging important?</h2>
<p>Runtime exceptions that prevent code from running are important to log to 
investigate and fix the source of the problems. Informational and debugging 
logging also helps to understand how the application is performing even if 
code is working as intended.</p>
<h2>Logging levels</h2>
<p>Logging is often grouped into several categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Information</li>
<li>Debug</li>
<li>Warning</li>
<li>Error</li>
</ol>
<p>Logging errors that occur while a web framework is running is crucial to
understanding how your application is performing. </p>
<h2>Logging aggregators</h2>
<p>When you are running your application on several servers, it is helpful
to have a monitoring tool called a "logging aggregator". You can configure 
your application to forward your system and application logs to one location 
that provides tools for viewing, searching, and monitoring logging events 
across your cluster. </p>
<p>Another advantage of log aggregation tools is they allow you to set up 
custom alerts and alarms so you can get notified when error rates breach a 
certain threshold.</p>
<h3>Open source log aggregators</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry">Sentry</a> started as a Django-only
  exception handling service but now has separate logging clients to cover 
  almost all major languages and frameworks. It still works really well for 
  Python-powered web applications and is often used in conjunction with other 
  monitoring tools. <a href="http://raven.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Raven</a> is open
  source Python client for Sentry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://graylog2.org/">Graylog2</a> provides a central server for log 
  aggregation as well as a GUI for browsing and searching through log events. 
  There are libraries for most major languages, including python. Saves data 
  in Elasticache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://logstash.net/">Logstash</a> Similar to Graylog2, logstash offers 
  features to programmatically configure log data workflows.</p>
</li>
<li>

<h2>Logging learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Read how to integrate logging into your web application framework. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure errors and anomalous results are logged. While these logs can be 
   stored in <a href="/monitoring.html">monitoring</a> solutions, it's best to have your 
   own log storage location to debug issues as they arise to complement other 
   monitoring systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate logging for system events you may need to use for debugging 
   purposes later. For example, you may want to know the return values on 
   functions when they are above a certain threshold. </p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Monitoring</h1>
<p>Monitoring tools capture, analyze and display information for a web 
application's execution. Every application has issues arise throughout
all levels of the web stack. Monitoring tools provide transparency so
developers and operations teams can respond and fix problems.</p>
<h2>Why is monitoring necessary?</h2>
<p>Capturing and analyzing data about your production environment is critical
to proactively deal with stability, performance, and errors in a web 
application.</p>
<h2>Difference between monitoring and logging</h2>
<p>Monitoring and logging are very similar in their purpose of helping to 
diagnose issues with an application and aid the debugging process. One way
to think about the difference is that logging happens based on explicit events
while monitoring is a passive background collection of data. </p>
<p>For example, when an error occurs, that event is explicitly logged through
code in an exception handler. Meanwhile, a monitoring agent instruments the
code and gathers data not only about the logged exception but also the 
performance of the functions.</p>
<p>This distinction between logging and monitoring is vague and not necessarily
the only way to look at it. Pragmatically, both are useful for maintaining a
production web application.</p>
<h2>Monitoring layers</h2>
<p>There are several important resources to monitor on the operating system 
and network level of a web stack.</p>
<ol>
<li>CPU utilization</li>
<li>Memory utilization</li>
<li>Persistence storage consumed versus free</li>
<li>Network bandwidth and latency</li>
</ol>
<p>Application level monitoring encompasses several aspects. The amount of time
and resources dedicated to each aspect will vary based on whether an 
application is read-heavy, write-heavy, or subject to rapid swings in traffic.</p>
<ol>
<li>Application warnings and errors (500-level HTTP errors)</li>
<li>Application code performance</li>
<li>Template rendering time</li>
<li>Browser rendering time for the application</li>
<li>Database querying performance</li>
</ol>

<h2>Monitoring learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Review the software-as-a-service and open source monitoring tools below. 
   Third party services tend to be easier to set up and host the data for 
   you. Open source projects give you more control but you'll need to have 
   additional servers ready for the monitoring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My recommendation is to install <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>'s free 
   option with the trial period to see how it works with your app. It'll give 
   you a good idea of the capabilities for application-level monitoring tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As your app scales take a look at setting up one of the the open source 
   monitoring projects such as StatsD with Graphite. The combination of those
   two projects will give you fine-grained control over the system metrics 
   you're collecting and visualizing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Web analytics</h1>
<p>Web analytics involves collecting, processing, visualizing web data to enable
critical thinking about how users interact with a web application.</p>
<h2>Why is web analytics important?</h2>
<p>User clients, especially web browsers, generate significant data while users
read and interact with webpages. The data provides insight into 
how visitors use the site and why they stay or leave. The key concept to
analytics is <em>learning</em> about your users so you can improve your web 
application to better suit their needs. </p>
<h2>Web analytics concepts</h2>
<p>It's easy to get overwhelmed at both the number of analytics services and
the numerous types of data points collected. Focus on just a handful of
metrics when you're just starting out. As your application scales and you 
understand more about your users add additional analytics services 
to gain further insight into their behavior with advanced visualizations such
as heatmaps and action funnels.</p>
<h3>User funnels</h3>
<p>If your application is
selling a product or service you can ultimately build a 
<a href="http://moz.com/blog/building-your-marketing-funnel-with-google-analytics">user funnel</a> (often called "sales funnel" prior to a user becoming a customer)
to better understand why people buy or don't buy what you're selling. With
a funnel you can visualize drop-off points where visitors leave your 
application before taking some action, such as purchasing your service.</p>
<h2>Open source web analytics projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a> is a web analytics platform you can host yourself.

<h2>Web analytics learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add Google Analytics or Piwik to your application. Both are free and while 
   Piwik is not as powerful as Google Analytics you can self-host the 
   application which is the only option in many environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think critically about the factors that will make your application 
   successful. These factors will vary based on whether it's an internal 
   <a href="/enterprise-python.html">enterprise</a> app, an e-commerce site or an 
   information-based application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add metrics generated from your web traffic based on the factors that 
   drive your application's success. You can add these metrics with either 
   some custom code or with a hosted web analytics service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuously reevaluate whether the metrics you've chosen are still the 
   appropriate ones defining your application's success. Improve and refine 
   the metrics generated by the web analytics as necessary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Docker</h1>
<p>Docker is an <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker">open source</a> 
infrastructure management platform for running and deploying software. The
Docker platform is constantly evolving so an exact definition is currently
a moving target.</p>
<h2>Why is Docker important?</h2>
<p>Docker can package up applications along with their necessary operating system
dependencies for easier deployment across environments. In the long run it
has the potential to be the abstraction layer that easily manages containers
running on top of any type of server, regardless of whether that server is
on Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine, Linode, Rackspace or elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Python projects within Docker images</h2>

          <h1>Caching</h1>
<p>Caching can reduce the load on servers by storing the results of common 
operations and serving the precomputed answers to clients. </p>
<p>For example, instead of retrieving data from database tables that rarely 
change, you can store the values in-memory. Retrieving values from an 
in-memory location is far faster than retrieving them from a database (which
stores them on a persistent disk like a hard drive.) When the cached values 
change the system can invalidate the cache and re-retrieve the updated values
for future requests.</p>
<p>A cache can be created for multiple layers of the stack. </p>
<h2>Caching backends</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://memcached.org/">memcached</a> is a common in-memory caching system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> is a key-value in-memory data store that can
  easily be configured for caching with libraries such as 
  <a href="https://github.com/sebleier/django-redis-cache">django-redis-cache</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Caching resources</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"<a href="https://bjornjohansen.no/caching-varnish-or-nginx">Caching: Varnish or Nginx?</a>"
  reviews some considerations such as SSL and SPDY support when choosing
  reverse proxy Nginx or Varnish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://bizcoder.com/caching-is-hard-draw-me-a-picture">Caching is Hard, Draw me a Picture</a>
  has diagrams of how web request caching layers work. The post is relevant
  reading even though the author is describing his Microsoft code as the 
  impetus for writing the content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While caching is a useful technique in many situations, it's important
  to also note that there are 
  <a href="https://msol.io/blog/tech/2015/09/05/youre-probably-wrong-about-caching/">downsides to caching</a>
  that many developers fail to take into consideration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Caching learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Analyze your web application for the slowest parts. It's likely there are
   complex database queries that can be precomputed and stored in an in-memory
   data store.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leverage your existing in-memory data store already used for session data
   to cache the results of those complex database queries. A 
   <a href="/task-queues.html">task queue</a> can often be used to precompute the results 
   on a regular basis and save them in the data store.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporate a cache invalidation scheme so the precomputed results remain 
   accurate when served up to the user.</p>
</li>
</ol>
          <h1>Microservices</h1>
<p>Microservices are an application architecture style where independent,
self-contained programs with a single purpose each can communicate with
each other over a network. Typically, these microservices are able to be
deployed independently because they have strong separation of 
responsibilities via a well-defined specification with significant 
backwards compatibility to avoid sudden dependency breakage.</p>
<h2>Why are microservices getting so much buzz?</h2>
<p>Microservices follow in a long trend of software architecture patterns
that become all the rage. Previously, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture">CORBA</a> 
and (mostly XML-based) service-oriented architectures (SOA) were the
hip buzzword among 
<a href="http://www.igloocoder.com/2271/ivory-tower-architect">ivory tower architects</a>.</p>
<p>However, microservices have more substance because they are typically based
on <a href="/application-programming-interfaces.html">RESTful APIs</a> that are far
easier for actual software developers to use compared with the previous 
complicated XML-based schemas thrown around by enterprise software companies.
In addition, successful applications begin with a monolith-first approach using
a single, shared application codebase and deployment. Only after the application
proves its usefulness is it then broken down into microservice components to
ease further development and deployment. This approach is called the 
"monolith-first" or 
"<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html">MonolithFirst</a>" pattern.</p>
<h3>Microservice resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Martin Fowler's 
  <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">microservices</a>

          <h1>DevOps</h1>
<p>DevOps is the combination of application development and operations, which
minimizes or eliminates the disconnect between software developers who build 
applications and systems administrators who keep infrastructure running.</p>
<h2>Why is DevOps important?</h2>
<p>When the Agile methodology is properly used to develop software a new
bottleneck often appears during the <a href="/deployment.html">deployment</a> and 
operations phases. New updates and fixes are produced so fast in each 
sprint that infrastructure teams can be overwhelmed with deployments and 
push back on the pace of delivery. To allievate some of these issues, 
application developers are asked to work closely with operations folks to
automate the delivery from development to production. </p>
<h2>General DevOps resources</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2015/mar/06/devops-vs-platform-engineering/">DevOps vs. Platform Engineering</a>
  considers DevOps an ad hoc approach to developing software while building
  a platform is a strict contract. I see this as "DevOps is a process",

  process.</p>

          <h1>Nginx</h1>
<p>Nginx is the 
<a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/cross/web_server/ranking">second most common web server among the top 100,000 websites</a>. Nginx also functions well as a 
reverse proxy to handle requests and pass back responses for Python 
<a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI servers</a> or even other web servers such as Apache.</p>
<p><img src="/img/web-servers-map.png" width="100%" alt="Python web application deployments rely on Nginx either as a web server or reverse proxy for WSGI servers." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<div class="well see-also">Nginx is an implementation of the <a href="/web-servers.html">web server</a> concept. Learn how these pieces fit together in the <a href="/deployment.html">deployment</a> chapter or view the <a href="/table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> for all topics.</div>

<h2>Should I use Nginx or the Apache HTTP Server?</h2>
<p>Let's be clear about these two "competing" servers: they are both fantastic
open source projects and either will serve your web application deployment 
well. In fact, many of the top global web applications use both servers in
their deployments to function in many steps throughout the HTTP 
request-response cycle.</p>
<p>I personally use Nginx more frequently than Apache because Nginx's 
configuration feel easier to write, with less boilerplate than alternatives.</p>
<p>There's also a bit of laziness in the usage: Nginx works well, it never causes
me problems. So I stick with my battle-tested 
Ansible <a href="/configuration-management.html">configuration management</a> files
that set up Nginx with HTTPS and SSL/TLS certificates </p>
<h2>Securing Nginx</h2>
<p>Nginx's default configuration after a standard installation through a
system package manager or compiling from source is a good base for security.
However, setting up ciphers and redirects can be confusing the first few
times you try it. It's a really good idea to read some of these tutorials
to make sure you are avoiding the most common security errors that plague
HTTP(S) configurations.</p>

          <h1>Apache HTTP Server</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTP Server</a> is a widely deployed web server
that can be used in combination with a WSGI module, such as mod_wsgi or a
stand-alone <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI server</a> to run Python web applications.</p>
<h2>Why is the Apache HTTP Server important?</h2>
<p>Apache remains the most commonly deployed web server with a reign of
20+ years. Its wide usage contributes to the large number of tutorials
and open source modules created by developers for anyone to use.</p>
<p>Apache's development began in mid-1994 as a fork of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_HTTPd">NCSA HTTP Server</a> project.
By early 1996, Apache overtook the previously dominant but suddenly stagnant 
NCSA server as NCSA's progress stalled due to signficantly reduced 
development attention.</p>

          <h1>Green Unicorn (Gunicorn)</h1>
<p><a href="http://gunicorn.org/">Green Unicorn</a>, commonly shortened to "Gunicorn", 
is a <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) server</a>
implementation that is commonly used to run Python web applications.</p>
<p><a href="http://gunicorn.org/" style="border: none;"><img src="/img/gunicorn-logo.jpg" width="100%" alt="Official Green Unicorn (Gunicorn) logo." class="technical-diagram"></a></p>
<h2>Why is Gunicorn important?</h2>
<p>Gunicorn is one of many WSGI server implementations, but it's particularly
important because it is a stable, commonly-used part of
<a href="/deployment.html">web app deployments</a> that's powered some of the
largest Python-powered web applications in the world, such as 
<a href="http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/13649370142/what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances">Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>Gunicorn implements the 
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/">PEP3333 WSGI server standard specification</a>
so that it can run Python web applications that implement the application
interface. For example, if you write a web application with a 
<a href="/web-frameworks.html">web framework</a> such as <a href="/django.html">Django</a>, 
<a href="/flask.html">Flask</a> or <a href="/bottle.html">Bottle</a>, then your application 
implements the WSGI specification. </p>
<div class="well see-also">Gunicorn is an implementation of the <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI servers</a> concept. Learn how these pieces fit together in the <a href="/deployment.html">deployment</a> chapter or view the <a href="/table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> for all topics.</div>

<h2>How does Gunicorn know how to run my web app?</h2>
<p>Gunicorn knows how to run a web application based on the hook between the 
WSGI server and the WSGI-compliant web app.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a typical Django web application and how it is run
by Gunicorn. We'll use the 
<a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/compare-python-web-frameworks/tree/master/django_defaults">django_defaults</a> 
as an example Django project. Within the <a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/compare-python-web-frameworks/tree/master/django_defaults/django_defaults">django_defaults</a> 
project subdirectory, there is a short <a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/compare-python-web-frameworks/blob/master/django_defaults/django_defaults/wsgi.py">wsgi.py</a>
file with the following contents:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="sd">WSGI config for django_defaults project.</span>

<span class="sd">It exposes the WSGI callable as a module-level variable named ``application``.</span>

<span class="sd">For more information on this file, see</span>
<span class="sd">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/deployment/wsgi/</span>
<span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>

<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.core.wsgi</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">get_wsgi_application</span>

<span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">environ</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">setdefault</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;django_defaults.settings&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">application</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">get_wsgi_application</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>That <code>wsgi.py</code> file was generated by the <code>django-admin.py startproject</code> command
when the Django project was first created. Django exposes an <code>application</code> 
variable via that <code>wsgi.py</code> file so that a WSGI server can use <code>application</code> 
as a hook for running the web app. Here's how the situation looks visually:</p>
<p><img src="/img/gunicorn-django-wsgi.png" alt="Gunicorn WSGI server invoking a Django WSGI application." width="100%" class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<h2>What's a "pre-fork" worker model?</h2>
<p>Gunicorn is based on a pre-fork worker model, compared to a worker model
architecture. The pre-work worker model means that a master thread spins up
workers to handle requests but otherwise does not control how those workers
perform the request handling. Each worker is independent of the controller.</p>

          <h1>Ubuntu</h1>
<p>Ubuntu is a Debian Linux-based operating system distribution often used for 
Python development and application deployment.</p>
<h2>Why is Ubuntu important for Python?</h2>
<p>Ubuntu is one of the most commonly used Linux distributions for both local
development and server deployments. Some 
<a href="/platform-as-a-service.html">platforms-as-a-service</a> such as Heroku run 
Ubuntu as the base operating system, so as a Python developer you'll often
have to work with Ubuntu or a similar Debian-based Linux operating system.</p>

<h2>What does "LTS" mean for Ubuntu?</h2>
<p>Every two years Ubuntu releases a Long-Term Support (LTS) version that
receives five years of updates instead of only two years for non-LTS
releases. However, there are some issues with the current LTS model,
in that you 
<a href="http://www.wilderssecurity.com/threads/ubuntu-lts-many-vulnerabilities-despite-long-term-support.385386/">must only use packages from the main repository</a> 
unless you're going to manually handle security updates for non-main
repository system packages.</p>

          <h1>Testing</h1>
<p>Testing determines whether software runs correctly based on specific inputs 
and identifies defects that need to be fixed.</p>
<h2>Why is testing important?</h2>
<p>As software scales in codebase size, it's impossible for a person or even 
a large team to keep up with all of the changes and
the interactions between the changes. Automated testing is the only proven
method for building reliable software once they grow past the point of a
simple prototype. Many major software program development failures can be
traced back to inadequate or a complete lack of testing.</p>
<p>It's impossible to know whether software works properly unless it is tested.
While testing can be done manually, by a user clicking buttons or typing in 
input, it should be performed automatically by writing software programs that
test the application under test.</p>
<p>There are many forms of testing and they should all be used together. When 
a single function of a program is isolated for testing, that is called
<a href="/unit-testing.html">unit testing</a>. Testing more than a single function 
in an application at the same time is known as 
<a href="/integration-testing.html">integration testing</a>. 
<em>User interface testing</em> ensures the correctness of how a user would 
interact with the software. There are even more forms of testing that large
programs need, such as <em>load testing</em>, <em>database testing</em>, and
<em>browser testing</em> (for web applications).</p>
<h2>Testing in Python</h2>
<p>Python software development culture is heavy on software testing. Because
Python is a dynamically-typed language as opposed to a statically-typed
language, testing takes on even greater importance for ensuring program
correctness.</p>
<h2>Testing resources</h2>

</li>
</ul>
          <h1>Unit testing</h1>
<p>Unit testing is a method of determining the correctness of a single function 
isolated from a larger codebase. The idea is that if all the atomic units
of an application work as intended in isolation, then integrating them 
together as intended is much easier.</p>
<h2>Why is unit testing important?</h2>
<p>Unit testing is just one form of <a href="/testing.html">testing</a> that works in
combination with other testing approaches to wring out the bugs from a
piece of software being developed. When several functions and classes are
put together it's often difficult to determine the source of a problem if
several bugs are occurring at the same time. Unit testing helps eliminate
as many of the individual bugs as possible so when the application comes
together as a whole the separate parts work as correct as possible. Then
when issues arise they can often be tracked down as unintended consequences
of the disparate pieces not fitting together properly.</p>
<h2>Unit testing tools</h2>
<p>There are many tools for creating tests in Python. Some of these tools, such
as pytest, replace the built-in unittest framework. Other tools, such as
nose, are extensions that ease test case creation. Note that many of these
tools are also used for <a href="/integration-testing.html">integration testing</a>
by writing the test cases to exercise multiple parts of code at once.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">unittest</a>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Yelp/Testify/">testify</a> was a testing framework

as intended. This type of <a href="/testing.html">testing</a> identifies defects in 
the interfaces between disparate parts of a codebase as they invoke 
each other and pass data between themselves.</p>
<h2>How is integration testing different from unit testing?</h2>
<p>While <a href="/unit-testing.html">unit testing</a> is used to find bugs in individual
functions, integration testing tests the system as a whole. These two
approaches should be used together, instead of doing just one approach over
the other. When a system is comprehensively unit tested, it makes 
integration testing far easier because many of the bugs in the individual
components will have already been found and fixed. </p>
<p>As a codebase scales up, both unit and integration testing allow 
developers to quickly identify breaking changes in their code. Many times
these breaking changes are unintended and wouldn't be known about until
later in the development cycle, potentially when an end user discovers 
the issue while using the software. Automated unit and integration tests
greatly increase the likelihood that bugs will be found as soon as possible
during development so they can be addressed immediately.</p>

          <h1>Code Metrics</h1>
<p>Code metrics can be produced by static code analysis tools to determine 
complexity and non-standard practices.</p>
<h2>Why are code metrics important?</h2>
<p>Code metrics allow developers to find problematic codebase areas that may
need refactoring. In addition, some metrics such as technical debt assist 
developers in communicating to non-technical audiences why issues with a
system are occurring.</p>
<h2>Open source code metrics projects</h2>

          <h1>Debugging</h1>
<p>Developers often find themselves in situations where the code they've written
is not working quite right. When that happens, a developer debugs their code
by instrumenting, executing and inspecting the code to determine what state
of the application does not match the assumptions of how the code should
be correctly running.</p>
<h2>Why is debugging important?</h2>
<p>There are bugs in every modest sized or larger application. Every 
developer has to learn how to debug code in order to write programs that
work as correctly as time and budget allow.</p>

          <h1>Bots</h1>
<p>Bots are software programs that combine requests, which are typically 
provided as text, with contextual data, such as geolocation and payment 
information, to appropriately handle the request and respond. Bots are
often also called "chatbots", "assistants" or "agents."</p>

</ul>
          <h1>What "full stack" means</h1>
<p>The terms "full stack" and "Full Stack Python" are ambiguous but I am using
a specific definition here on this site. These term can be defined for a 
web stack either to mean</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Every layer, from the machine code up to the browser, are written in Python </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python code interacts with code written in other languages such as C and
   JavaScript to provide a complete web stack</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I named this site specifically for the second definition: Python is one
programming language among many that are used to build your application 
stack. </p>
<p>Some folks took the title of the site to mean Python runs everything from 
the web browser on down. That's simply not practical or possible. While Python 
is an amazing programming language, there are many tasks it does not do well.</p>
<p>Python is just one language among many that allows our computers to execute 
software and communicate with each other. </p>
<p>For beginners, learning the syntax and libraries in Python necessary to 
build a web application or web API is a major undertaking. Even intermediate 
and advanced Python software developers need to constantly program and learn 
to keep up with our ever evolving ecosystem. I created Full Stack Python to
be just one of <a href="/best-python-resources.html">many resources</a> that help Python 
developers build and maintain their programming skills.</p>
          <h1>Change Log</h1>
<p>This is a running list of the major changes to Full Stack Python since its
inception in December 2012. Another way to view the modifications is through
the 
<a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.github.com/commits/gh-pages">source repository's commit log</a> on GitHub.</p>

          <h1>Future Directions</h1>
<p>Full Stack Python has completely blown away my expectations for what I could
accomplish with a side project. I really appreciate all the in-person feedback,
emails and pull requests I've received from the community. Keep them coming!</p>
<p>For 2016 I'm building out the scope of the site beyond web development into
core Python concepts, data analysis and visualization and (hopefully) some 
hardware hacking such as with the Raspberry Pi and Arduino Yun.</p>
<p>A huge update was released in the form of the
<a href="http://www.deploypython.com/">The Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments</a>,
a step-by-step tutorial book for learning how to deploy Python web 
applications.</p>
<p>Note that these plans can change based on 
<a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com/pulls">pull requests</a>
from the community. I work to integrate PRs within a day or two so please 
submit one when you see a fix or improvement that needs to be made!</p>
